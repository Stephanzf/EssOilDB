It was first explored in Fitzpatrick&#x02019;s Dermatology in General Medicine, Chapter 241 - Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Dermatology, published in 2007. The authors stated that &#x0201c;Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) in dermatology encompasses a wide variety of methods of diagnosis and treatment that either supplement or substitute for conventional dermatologic practice, drawing on an expanded knowledge base that includes CAM, conventional practice, and the latest research findings. Its diagnostic and therapeutic choices are made by combining these three knowledge bases, in what might also be termed integrative dermatology&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In the late 70&#x02019;s and early 80&#x02019;s, the main treatment options for dermatological conditions were exclusively in the domain of mainstream or conventional medicine. However, in some western countries, Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) was becoming more popular. As patients began to seek alternative treatment approaches using natural therapies to treat their skin conditions, CAM practitioners, including naturopaths, began to experiment with western herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine to meet the needs of their patients. Naturopaths tended to rely heavily on anecdotal and traditional treatments from historical data rather than on scientific research results.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>History of Mainstream Medicine/Allopathic Medicine for Dermatological Conditions</title><p>Mainstream medicine, although effective, mainly focused on providing symptomatic relief using topicals and/ or systemic, either as orals or injectables. Corticosteroids were first introduced in the treatment of psoriasis in 1952 with the topical application of hydrocortisone. Later, the steroid molecule was fluoridated which allowed more potent steroids like fluocinolone acetonide, betamethasone valerate and clobestadol propionate to be developed. These were then enhanced with occlusive dressings or by using combination therapies with salicylic acid and tars [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The 50&#x02019;s also saw the introduction of folate inhibitors like methotrexate, in both topical and as systemic preparations. In the 70&#x02019;s, Retinoids, analogues of Vitamin A, began to be used, especially for erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis, again as topical and systemic, with the first clinical trial on Isotretinoin undertaken in 1972. Later, other second-generation Vitamin A analogues, Etretinate (Retinoic Acid) and Acitretin were introduced as either topical and/or systemic. In the mid 80&#x02019;s analogues of Vitamin D (Calciprotriol) was found to also be of benefit in the topical treatment of psoriasis and by the mid-90s oral calcitriol (Vitamin D) became available [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>][<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>][<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Phototherapy was and is still one of the most common treatment options for psoriasis, with narrowband UVB (nbUVB) or psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA) the most widely used applications. In the 50&#x02019;s, Dr John Ingram developed a treatment regimen using ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in conjunction with coal tar and anthralin paste, and by the 70&#x02019;s, broadband UVB was found to be effective in clearing mild forms of psoriasis, whilst ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation in combination with either oral or topical application of psoralen, was also being used. By the 80&#x02019;s narrowband UVB (nbUVB) was found to be effective in treating psoriasis [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>With the advent of biologics to treat autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, researchers experimented during the 90&#x02019;s in the treatments of various systemic and cutaneous diseases. Biologics are protein molecules produced by recombinant DNA technology, which target the specific sites in the immune - pathogenesis pathway of the diseases by blocking these pathways. Because of the specific action on the immune system, biologics are considered to have fewer side effects compared to the traditional immune - suppressants. However, the use of biologics is still limited because of the unknown long-term safety profile and various aspects of the biologics [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>History of Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) and CAM Therapies for Dermatological conditions</title><p>Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) is mainly focused on treating the human body as a whole in the hope that the dermatological condition would benefit from their treatment(s). CAM includes naturopathic compounded creams using herbal ingredients, herbal systems and nutritional supplementation and &#x0201c;detox&#x0201d; diets.</p><p>The history of CAM and the treatment of dermatological conditions are founded on the use of specific herbs solely developed based on locally available plants and through trade in ethnobotanical remedies. Various schools of herbal use developed regionally in Europe,</p><p>the Middle East, Africa, India, China, Japan, Australia, and the Americas. The best-known systems still in use today are the Ayurvedic herbs originated from India, herbal treatments developed as part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China, and Western Herbal Medicine developed in the United States and based on European and Native American traditions and later influenced by TCM [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Unlike the developing countries where traditional medicine remains entrenched in the treatment of various conditions including skin conditions, Europe and the United States saw a steady decrease during the 1900&#x02019;s in the use of herbal treatments and the number of herbalists, as purified extracts and synthetic chemical drugs became available. However, from the 70&#x02019;s onwards there has been a steady resurgence in the use of herbal treatments and the number of visits to CAM practitioners. The causes for this are varied including:- the increase in the identification of serious side effects of chemical drugs, the increased cost of mainstream medications, the lack of long-term efficacy of mainstream medication and a general desire to return to nature, natural remedies and an alteration to diet to include organic produce. Thus herbal remedies, including those for skin conditions, are continually gaining greater popularity among patients and to a lesser degree greater tolerance and/ or acceptance among General Practitioners [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In the United States, the number of visits to CAM practitioners has grown rapidly, estimated to have increased from 427 million in 1990 to 629 million in 1997. This 1997 figure exceeded the number of visits Americans made to all primary care physicians in the United States during that same year. Furthermore, it is estimated that between 50% and 75% of the US population is using some form of CAM at a given time [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In the European Union, there are approximately 150,000 dual-trained doctors, meaning trained in conventional medicine and a particular CAM modality. In addition to these dually trained doctors, there are in the order of 180,000 non-doctor CAM practitioners. However, the prevalence rates of the main therapies in use are much harder to define, as statistical records are basic at best and therapies monitored and reporting methods differ from country to country. As an example, for Herbal Medicine (31 studies), the prevalence rates varied from 5.9 - 48.3% of the population studies. However, herbal medicine was not well defined (it may have been included in naturopathy, folk medicine or traditional Chinese medicine) and different categories including medical herbalism, herbal remedies, herbal teas and Phytotherapy [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Notwithstanding the number of alternate therapies that are included under the banner of CAM, for this review, the following will be considered: TCM, Ayurveda and Western Herbal Medicine and Naturopathy.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Traditional Chinese Medicine</title><p>The conceptual foundation of TCM is entirely different from that of western medicine. TCM is centred on the five solid organs &#x02212; heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney and six hollow viscera &#x02212; large and small intestine, urinary bladder, stomach, gall bladder, and &#x02019;triple burners&#x02019;. These &#x02019;structures&#x02019; are connected by conduits and vessels with &#x02019;Qi&#x02019; (energy) and blood circulating through them. There is no equivalent counterpart in conventional Western medicine for Qi. TCM treatment is based on the diagnosis of the individual as a whole rather that the Western mainstream medical approach which typically concentrates on the disease. TCM uses a process called &#x02019;syndrome identification&#x02019;, whereby the practitioner makes a dynamic conceptualisation of the individual&#x02019;s situation and comes up with a &#x02019;pathophysiologic status&#x02019; (the type of disharmony) for the individual; this status is called &#x02019;zheng&#x02019; or &#x02019;syndrome&#x02019;. The therapeutics used to restore the harmony within the host and between the host and their environment are determined by the identified &#x02019;syndrome&#x02019; [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Because TCM views all diseases as patterns of symptoms that correspond to individual disorders or syndromes, the aim is to treat the pattern disorder which is the cause of the problem and not the disease itself. For example, one of the common patterns in acne is &#x0201c;Lung Heat&#x0201d; and is seen as the most common pattern in a teenager. It is important to note that not all patients with acne are treated in the same way. A TCM treatment protocol might include a combination of Acupuncture, Chinese herbs in either raw, tinctured or pill form, external herbal washes or creams and dietary advice.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>TCM and Acupuncture</title><p>The World Health Organisation recognises acupuncture as a suitable treatment for a wide variety of different conditions [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Acupuncture means to puncture with a needle. Acupuncture is usually, but not always, combined with herbal medicine. The needles are small, sterile and disposable. Patients do not normally feel any pain, although they may experience a feeling of warmth, tingling, dull ache or a heavy sensation, which the Chinese call &#x02019;sour&#x02019;.</p><p>In many Asian countries, skin diseases are customarily treated with acupuncture. However, there have been very few controlled studies published. In a randomised controlled clinical trial on chloasma, acupuncture had a significantly better effect than vitamins C and E. Some evidence favouring acupuncture treatment of herpes zoster (human (alpha) herpes virus) has been reported. It has been established that acupuncture has an anti-pruritic effect. This has been shown experimentally in volunteers, suggesting that acupuncture could be used in clinical conditions associated with pruritus. Acupuncture with dermal needles has traditionally been used in the treatment of neurodermatitis, with confirmation of its effect in a controlled clinical trial &#x0201c;Treatment of 60 cases of neurodermatitis with three-step seven-star needling therapy&#x0201d;, published in the Journal of Guiyang Chinese Medical College, 1998. Acupuncture, particularly ear acupuncture, has also been used in the treatment of acne vulgaris. In one study published in 2012 a single-blind clinical trial on 84 outpatients with psoriasis vulgaris by auricular therapy (ear acupuncture) combined with a TCM Yin Xie ling Formula, reported reduction scores in the treatment group of 74.4% [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>][<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>TCM and Chinese Herbs</title><p>The herbal medicine used in TCM can come in various forms. The most common form of prescription involves a selection of herbs specifically chosen for the patient and &#x0201c;cooked&#x0201d;, usually by the patient as a decoction (tea). The cooking time can be over hours, and most patients find that the actual decoctions are not very palatable. Tinctures are herbal preparations made in alcoholic bases and pills are also prescribed. Up to 8 to 12 pills may be taken twice per day, as the pills are made of herbal plant material, not concentrated chemicals.</p><p>In one clinical trial carried out at the Hospital for Sick Children, London, England, a Chinese physician, Dr. Luo, formulated a mixture of 10 herbs for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, consisting of Clematis armandii, Dictamnus dasycarpus, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Ledebouriella satellites, Lophatherum gracile, Rehmannia glutinosa, Paeonia lactiflora, Potentilla Chinensis, Tribulus Terrestris, and Schizonepeta tenuifolia. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, there was a clear distinction between the genuine TCM therapy and the placebo herbs. With the active herbs, there was a median decrease in erythema of 91.4% and a decrease in the extent of surface involvement of 85.7% [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Washes are decocted herbs that are used externally on the body, usually twice daily. Depending on the herbal prescription proposed the purpose was to assist with various symptoms including extreme itching, heat, ulcerations as well as the healing of the skin.</p><p>A 1 - year follow - up with both children and adults who chose to continue to use TCM showed a persistent benefit with only minimal side effects.</p><p>This is in contrast to the clinical deterioration of patients who elected to discontinue use of TCM in the ensuing year. It is of interest to note that many of the patients, both children and adults, who chose to continue TCM, were able to decrease the frequency of their TCM to less than daily use, while still others were able to discontinue treatment altogether without experiencing a relapse [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1-7"><title>TCM and Diet</title><p>Dietary therapy in TCM is considered extremely important as all foods possess a certain &#x0201c;nature&#x0201d;, which include Cold, Hot, Sweet, Sour etc., which can affect the body. During a consultation, the TCM practitioner usually advises the patient to avoid certain foods considered to potentially aggravate the condition. The patient is also advised to eat more of the foods that are beneficial for the condition. For example, it is important to avoid hot spicy foods in skin conditions as they create more heat in the body and hence more redness or itching.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-8"><title>Ayurvedic Medicine</title><p>Ayurveda originates from India, and the Ayurvedic system of medicine describes a wide range of etiological factors for dermatological disorders. The etiological factors include physical, physiological, psychological, psychosocial, and hereditary and Papakarma (sinful activities) aspect. Ayurveda emphasises threefold therapeutic management based on (avoiding causative factors) for almost all types of disorders including dermatological disorders. Ayurvedic therapy is probably the hardest for non-Indian Practitioners to comprehend as the combined use of herbal formulas with chants, mantras, gems etc. is far more complicated and foreign. Most of the herbs described for the management of dermatological disorders in Ayurveda are &#x0201c;Rasayana drugs&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Various studies on &#x0201c;Rasayana drugs&#x0201d; suggest the following therapeutic properties:</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- Immunomodulator</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Adaptogenic</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Antioxidant</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Nootropic</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Antistress</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In Ayurveda, &#x0201c;Rasayana drugs&#x0201d; are considered very important for the management of dermatological disorders. Skin health is restored and maintained by directly targeting the different layers and cells of the skin involved in the process of skin ageing &#x00026; dysfunction and also in the pathogenesis of a disease. Diet modification or dietary supplementation is also very much emphasised in the Ayurvedic system of medicine for the prevention, as well as management, of disorders including skin conditions. The diet rich in Amla (Indian gooseberry), Lavana (salt) and Katu Rasa (pungent, spicy), milk, curd, jaggery (cane sugar), and a diet which is unbalanced should be avoided.</p><p>The recommended diet includes old wheat, old barley, pulses like Moonga (brown beans), Masoor (red lentils), Arhar (split pigeon peas), honey, Patola (Luffa cylindrical &#x02013; vegetable from the gourd family), Neem (leaf), garlic, old Ghrita (ghee) and Tikta Rasa (bitter herbal juices). Also, Triphala (made up of these three fruits, dried and powdered - Amalaki (Emblica officials or Phyllanthus emblica), haritaki (Terminalia chebula) and bibhitaki (Terminalia bellirica)) is important [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In Ayurveda, the therapy in the form of &#x0201c;Rasayana drugs&#x0201d; and diets cannot be effective unless the body channels are properly cleansed, and toxic materials are eliminated. Samshodhan (detoxification) is believed to purify or cleanse all the body tissues and bring about the harmony of bio-humours to obtain long-lasting beneficial effects. So, Ayurvedic practice is to incorporate divine therapy or psychological therapy including chanting Mantras, the spiritual use of herbs and gems, sacrifices, offerings and washing with ceremonial penances, fasting, and other rituals for social wellbeing etc. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>There have been published &#x0201c;trials&#x0201d; on the success of Ayurvedic treatments for psoriasis and vitiligo, but these studies are difficult to assess. As an example, in one study patients were randomly divided into two groups. Koshtha Shuddhi was done using Eranda bhrushta haritaki (6g at night with ushnodaka) for both groups for three days before starting the treatment. A total of 111 patients were selected for the study and divided into two groups - A and B. Group A (45) patients were given &#x0201c;Navayasa Rasayana Leha&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Dhatryadhyo lepa&#x0201d; for the external application while Group B (49) patients were given Medhya Rasayana tablet along with the application of Dhatryadhyo lepa.</p><p>The duration of the study was three months, and follow-up was done for one month. Both the groups showed equally good results on improving the quality of life in the patients regarding Dermatology life quality index and Psoriasis disability index.</p><p>The study was also coupled with Laboratory investigations and a DLQI and Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) questionnaire.</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Blood &#x02013; Hemoglobin (Hb), total count (TC), differential count (DC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), total red blood cells (RBC), and peripheral blood picture.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Urine &#x02013; Routine and microscopic examination.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Biochemical &#x02013; Fasting blood sugar (FBS), serum creatinine, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum calcium, total protein, albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The study did not show any PASI scoring nor were the results of the laboratory investigations detailed. The authors only reported on the DLQI and the PDI results. The overall effect on PDI showed that both the therapies had highly significant relief (P&#x0003c; 0.001), but percentage wise, group A showed better relief by 72.20% whereas group B showed relief by 65.99%. While DLQI showed beneficial effects of therapy, group A showed 70.26% relief, whereas group B showed 67.64% relief [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Western Herbal Medicine (WHM), Naturopathy and Dermatological Conditions Western Herbal Medicine (WHM) covers the following therapies:- Herbal medicine, Phytotherapy, Botanical medicine, Medical herbalism, Herbalism.19 Herbalists are defined as health practitioners who engage in extemporaneous compounding of herbs for therapeutic purposes for individuals under their care and are broadly classified under Western, or European, herbal practice. Two systems of knowledge are identified within</p><p>Western herbal medicine: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) and Traditional Knowledge (TK) [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>EBM has developed as a way to evaluate and generate biomedical knowledge, and to link research findings with clinical application. &#x0201c;Evidence-based medicine is defined as &#x0201c;the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients&#x0201d;. The practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Traditional Knowledge is used to cover a range of fields, which are referred to as Traditional Ecological Knowledge, Indigenous Knowledge and Folk Knowledge. All of these terms relate to the knowledge which has been developed by indigenous and traditional cultures about their environment [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Plants and their secondary metabolite constituents, have a long history of use in modern WHM and certain systems of traditional medicine, and in mainstream medicine are the sources of important drugs such as aspirin (from willow bark), digoxin (from foxglove), quinine (from cinchona bark), and morphine (from the opium poppy) [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Since the latter half of the twentieth century, monographs on selected herbs have become available from some sources, including the European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP, 1999), German Commission E (Blumenthal et al., 1998) and the World Health Organization (WHO, 1999).</p><p>The WHO monographs classify the herb according to a number of criteria including botanical, synonyms and vernacular names; the herbal part commonly used such as leaf, stem, root, flower etc., its geographical distribution, tests used to identify and characterize the herb (including macroscopic and microscopic examination and purity testing), the active principles (when known), dosage forms and dosing, medicinal uses, pharmacology, contra-indications and adverse reactions.</p><p>Other resources that provide detailed information about herbal products in current use include the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database and the European Commission on herbal medicinal products in the European Union (EU) [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1-9"><title>Naturopathy</title><p>Naturopathy incorporates traditional natural remedies including herbal remedies, nutrition, acupuncture, traditional Asian medicine, hydrotherapy, and other modalities. Overall, naturopathy focuses on the use of non-toxic, natural remedies. In the US and Canada, Naturopathic Practitioners are trained as family and general physicians and can be registered as doctors. However, in most other countries, this level of training or recognition has not occurred [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The tenets of Naturopathy seem worthy:</p><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- First, do no harm</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Use the healing power of nature, the body&#x02019;s innate healing power</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Treat the underlying cause of the disease, not just the symptoms</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Treat the whole person &#x02013; holistic health</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Educate the patient about their health</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Focus on preventing disease</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Some of the modalities involved in Naturopathic Medicine [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], include:</p><p>Clinical Nutrition - Naturopathic Practitioner, has the belief that diet is the basis for health, hence encouraging their patients to adopt an appropriate healthy diet, which is the first step towards correcting health problems. Naturopathic Practitioners may use specific individualised diets, fasting, and nutritional supplements.</p><p>Lifestyle Counselling and Stress Management - Mental attitudes and emotional states are considered to be important elements in healing and cause of disease. Naturopathic Practitioners are trained in counselling, stress management, hypnotherapy, and biofeedback.</p><p>Botanical Medicine - Plants have powerful healing properties. Many pharmaceutical drugs have their origins in plant substances. Naturopathic Practitioners use plant substances in varied forms for their healing effects and nutritional value.</p><p>Physical Medicine - Naturopathic medicine includes methods of therapeutic manipulation of muscles and bones. Naturopathic Practitioners may also employ therapeutic exercise, massage, hydrotherapy, bio - electrical therapies, ultrasound, and the use of heat and cold applications.</p><p>TCM &#x02013; Some Naturopathic Practitioners are trained in the fundamentals of TCM and diagnosis.

Usually, the clinical trials are on the single herb at various doses and in various carriers, including creams, gels, and petroleum bases. This makes it exceptionally difficult to quantifiably state that a certain percentage of herbal extract &#x0201c;Y&#x0201d; is consistently efficacious in resolving a certain skin condition. Much research time and effort have been spent in trying to identify the active ingredients and therapeutic properties, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiseptic.</p><p>In 2006, an evidence-based systematic review by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration was conducted on calendula. They concluded that much of the research had been done on animals and as such may be of limited use only when assessing viability in treating skin conditions. However, while recognising that traditionally, calendula has been used topically for treating minor wounds, burns and other skin problems, they found that there was no strong scientific evidence to support this use.</p><p>However, they felt that there was good scientific evidence to support the use of calendula in Radiation dermatitis [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Calendula can prevent oxidative stress, making it theoretically an ideal treatment for radiodermatitis. It is thought that this occurs via the numerous polyphenols contained in its extract. Polyphenols have many potentially therapeutic roles as antioxidants on the skin. The pylene glycol extract of Calendula has been studied, with results showing that it interferes with neutrophil radical oxygen species (ROS) and radical nitrogen species (RNS) generation, particularly nitric oxide, at concentrations as low as 0.2 &#x003bc;g/mL [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1-13"><title>The Need for a New and Different Approach</title><p>In the 80&#x02019;s the need for a new and different approach became more and more apparent, as neither mainstream nor CAM seemed to be fulfilling the needs of the patient. In the past, both CAM and mainstream medicine remained at opposite ends and were never to interact. In the 80&#x02019;s, Dr Michael Tirant saw the opportunity to bring the two closer together, especially in the treatment of dermatological conditions, where he had developed very effective treatment protocols, including the use of bio - herbal actives.</p><p>The question was: &#x0201c;How could CAM and allopathic medicine be brought together to offer a more effective treatment approach, which has more longterm benefits for the patients?&#x0201d;</p><p>For a longterm solution to psoriasis or other dermatological conditions for that matter, it is vital to identify triggers of these conditions and understand the pathways of how they elicit a flare-up. His research identified many triggers, including drugs, infections, trauma, chemicals, alcohol, smoking, hormones, stress, diet, and lifestyle issues.</p><p>Interestingly, some of these triggers initiate a flare - up while others continue to exacerbate the condition. Scientific reports (internal publications) were written on individual triggers and circulated to doctors. Lectures and talks were organised at doctors&#x02019; clinics and seminars to promote his findings. Unfortunately, he was not able to publish his findings as most journals declined publication because the findings were not scientific or legitimate.</p><p>He spent many years working on bacterial superantigens - how they could elicit a flare - up in psoriasis, and how they could be targeted using bio-herbal therapies. Many of the herbs that were tested during the initial stages possessed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-microbial (viral/bacterial/fungal), anti-pruritic and analgesic properties.</p><p>This brought in a very scientific and medical approach that resonated with doctors and formed a stepping stone for collaboration. The outstanding results achieved with patients helped to open doors, both in Australia and overseas, and brought more acceptance and credibility for his treatments.</p><p>Although there was a reluctance for his work initially, the medical fraternity has, over the years, started to accept that Tirant&#x02019;s protocols are effective in the treatment of many skin diseases. In Australia, doctors in Integrative practices started to incorporate his treatments with orthodox drugs and so began Integrative Dermatology in Australia. His treatment protocols are now used by patients and doctors in many countries around the world.

He has developed over 40 topical formulations for symptomatic relief and over 25 oral supplements to target triggering factors of many dermatological conditions including psoriasis, eczema, ichthyosis, rosacea, fungal infections and acne. The treatments are now used in many countries around the world.</p><p>The exact combination of herbal ingredients, specifically the essential oils, is carefully chosen for the treatment of a skin condition and is based on the therapeutic properties and bioactive plant compounds of the various ingredients. This creates a synergistic compounding effect of the actives that work on specific pathways.</p><p>Essential oils are highly complex mixtures of volatile compounds with some containing more than 100 different components. The major volatile constituents are hydrocarbons (pinene, limonene, bisabolene), alcohols (linalool, santalol), acids (benzoic acid, organic acid), aldehydes (citral), cyclic aldehydes (criminal), ketones (camphor), lactones (bergaptene), phenols (eugenol), phenolic ethers (anethole), oxides (1, 8 cineole) and esters (geranyl acetate). All these compounds may be classified into two main categories: terpenoids and phenylpropanoids.</p><p>Essential oil compounds are fat - soluble, and thus they had the ability to permeate the membranes of the skin before being captured by the micro-circulation and drained into the systemic circulation, which reaches all targets. Currently, no one study gives a clear explanation of the mode of action of essential oils. Given the complexity of their chemical composition, it would suggest a complexity that makes it difficult to identify the overall molecular pathway of action(s). It is quite possible that each of the constituents of essential oils may have its mechanism of action [<xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]</p><p>That said, there are several proposed cellular actions or mechanisms that may explain the anti-inflammatory activity of medicinal plants that have been observed in vivo. These mechanisms include anti-oxidative and radical scavenging activities, regulation of cellular activities of the inflammation-related cells - mast cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. They have many actions including inhibition of histamine release and T - cell proliferation.</p><p>They also modulate the enzymatic activities of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolising enzymes, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX1 and COX 2), and lipoxygenase (LOX) and the nitric oxide (NO) producing enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS).

These augment auto-debridement and keratinocyte migration during wound repair.<break/>Zinc confers resistance to epithelial apoptosis through stabilising cellular membranes. It protects cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and bacterial toxins through anti - oxidant activity of cysteine-rich metallothioneins (MT) and superoxide dismutase.<break/>Salicylic acid facilitates desquamation by solubilising the intercellular cement that binds scales in the nail plate, thereby loosening the keratin and facilitating the penetration of other medicaments into the nail plate.<break/>The keratolytic effect of Salicylic acid may also provide an antifungal action because the disruption of the keratin also suppresses fungal growth. It also aids in the penetration of other antifungal agents.<break/>Salicylic acid also has a mild antiseptic action and possesses anti - inflammatory, ant I -pruritic, analgesic and antimicrobial properties. Its anti-inflammatory and analgesic action appears to be mediated by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme.<break/>Many of the essential oils are known for their hydrophobicity, which enables them to partition the lipids of the bacterial cell membrane and mitochondria. This disrupts the cell structures and renders them more permeable.<break/>Extensive leakage from bacterial cells or the exit of critical molecules and ions will lead to their demise.<break/>In general, it is proposed that most essential oils target microbial cell membranes, affecting their integrity or permeability or compromising membrane-associated functions (primarily respiration). This leads to fungal cell wall polymer degradation, membrane channel and pore formation, and damage to ribosomal inhibition of DNA synthesis and the cell cycle. Almost all of the essential oils have some antibacterial/antifungal functionality.<break/>Many of these essential oils are also known for their antioxidant properties. This is most often due to phenolic acids (gallic, protocatechuic, caffeic and rosmarinic acids), phenolic diterpenes (carnosol, carnosic acid, rosmanol, and rosmadial), flavonoids (quercetin, catechin, naringenin and kaempferol), and volatile oils (eugenol, carvacrol, thymol and menthol).</td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Topical &#x02013; 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119</bold><break/>Zinc oxide Salicylic acid<break/>Sweet almond Oil<break/>Jojoba Seed Oil<break/>Avocado Oil<break/>Carrot Seed Oil<break/>Calendula extract<break/>Orange Oil<break/>Wheat germ Oil<break/>Apricot Kernel Oil<break/>Lavender Oil<break/>Sandalwood Oil<break/>Patchouli Oil<break/>Emu Oil<break/>Bergamot Oil<break/>Rosemary oil<break/>Geranium Oil<break/>Evening primrose Oil<break/>Eucalyptus Oil<break/>Pine needle oil Chamomile oil Myrrh Oil<break/>Neroli Oil</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Essential oils can inhibit the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).<break/>They can also increase the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and inactivate nuclear transcription factor &#x003ba;appa B (NF-&#x003ba;B).<break/>Chamomile oil contains alpha-bisabolol, which oxides A &#x00026; B, and matricin (usually converted to chamazulene) and other flavonoids.

In psoriasis, studies have revealed increased markers of oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity in plasma, in white blood cells and skin.</p><p>The comprehension of the role of immune function in psoriasis could permit the management of this complex disease, which dramatically affects patients far beyond the skin. In fact, cytokines and growth factors released by activated T cells have been shown to display a prominent role in keratinocyte formation. Six of the essential oils in Dr Michaels&#x000ae; (Soratinex&#x000ae;) family of products (calendula, patchouli, geranium, neroli, myrrh (OME)), were studied for redox status of fibroblast primary culture from lesional psoriatic skin hyperproliferation.</p><p>The study focused on dermal fibroblasts, which are involved in the accelerating keratinocyte proliferation of developing psoriatic lesions. According to the results, the total antioxidant capacity of OME (at the 1:5000 dilution) resulted equivalent to 163.6mM Trolox, which indicated a very high antioxidant capacity for the provided oil mixture [<xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p><p>The preliminary experiment aimed at evaluating the effect of OME on cell viability. A further dose-dependent test was carried out in psoriatic fibroblasts in the presence of increasing OME concentrations ranging from 1:1000 to 1:10000. The results indicated that treatment with 1:5000 OME increased the viability of psoriatic fibroblasts by 37.9 &#x000b1; 1.7% compared to untreated cells.</p><p>A significant decrease in intracellular ROS production was observed in OME-treated fibroblasts compared to untreated fibroblasts as revealed by confocal analysis [<xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p><p>The results indicated a strong protective, redox balancing effect of OME obtained from the vegetable oil mixture (Dr Michaels&#x000ae; Soratinex&#x000ae; family products) and if used at an appropriate concentration, significantly increases the viability and decreases intracellular ROS production in human psoriatic fibroblasts. A strong antioxidant effect of the OME obtained from Dr Michaels mixture of oils may be a reason for the effectiveness of the mixture in the topical treatment of psoriasis [<xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p><p>The oral supplement range consisted of a specific combination of herbs, either leaf, bark, root, stolen or bulb. The normal dose is one tablet twice daily, however for short periods in the acute stage, two tablets twice daily may be prescribed for 3 - 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-14"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although initially considered unscientific, today many herbs have been scientifically trialled to elucidate their efficacy, mode of action and possible adverse events for them to be safely combined with modern medicine.</p><p>Today Integrative Dermatology is well-accepted internationally with many new practices starting in many countries, such as the USA.</p><p>Many integrative dermatologists combine integrative approaches in their clinics; such as minerals, herbal products, stress management techniques and clinical nutrition, to achieve the best outcomes for their patients.</p><p>These practitioners now realise that the best approach is one where the appropriate triggers for each patient are considered, as each is unique.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research did not receive any financial support</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Competing Interests:</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lowell</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><source>Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Practice;published by the McGraw-Hill Companies</source><year>2007</year><edition>7th edition</edition></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Landis</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Dermatology in the United States</article-title><source>The Journal of Alternative And Complementary Medicine</source><year>2014</year><volume>20</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>392</fpage><lpage>398</lpage><comment>https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2013.0327 PMid:24517329 PMCid:PMC4011482</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24517329</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tirant</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Successful Treatment of A Chronic Eczema In A 48-Year-Old Female With Dr Michaels&#x000ae;(Eczitinex&#x000ae;And Itchinex&#x000ae;) Product Family</article-title><source>A Case Report;Journal of Biological Regulators &#x00026; Homeostatic</source><year>2016</year><volume>30</volume><issue>2(S3)</issue><fpage>35</fpage><lpage>42</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tirant</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Nail Psoriasis In An Adult Successfully Treated With A Series Of Herbal Skin Care Products Family &#x02013;A Case Report</article-title><source>Journal Of Biological Regulators &#x00026; Homeostatic</source><year>2016</year><volume>30</volume><issue>(2(S3)</issue><fpage>21</fpage><lpage>28</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brajac</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><source>History of Psoriasis</source><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.intechopen.com">www.intechopen.com</uri></comment><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/32469/InTech-History_of_psoriasis.pdf">http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/32469/InTech-History_of_psoriasis.pdf</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boisseau-Garsaud</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Treatment of psoriasis by oral calcitriol.
