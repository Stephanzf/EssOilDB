Abstract</div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p>Pruritus reduces quality of life and may occur at different sites of the body. To alleviate pruritus, lipid replenishing and rehydration of the skin is often unsatisfactory. Thus, products with additional antipruritic effects are needed. </p> </div> <div class="objectives" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Objectives</div> <p>Antipruritic effects and cosmetic properties of two different emulsions, water-in-oil (w/o) or oil-in-water (o/w), and a shampoo containing a lipophilic <i>Echinacea purpurea</i> root extract (Ec.-extract) were assessed in adults suffering from pruritus. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p>Adults (n = 55) with pruritus of the body applied a w/o emulsion for 2 weeks. In a separate study, adults (n = 33) with a pruritic scalp applied an o/w-emulsion for 4 weeks. In a third study, shampoo (n = 34) was applied for 4 weeks. Objective (erythema, dryness, and papules) and subjective (intensity, duration, and burden of pruritus) parameters were assessed. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p>Treatment with the w/o emulsion significantly reduced erythema and dryness ( <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001) as well as pruritus (in 93% of participants) on the body. Treatment with the o/w-emulsion on the scalp significantly ( <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001) reduced objective (erythema in 61% and dryness in 85% of participants) and subjective (85% of participants had reduced pruritus) parameters. Similar results in reduction of dryness (76% of participants) and pruritus (70 % of participants) were seen after 4 weeks of shampoo use. </p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p>Independent from the type of emulsion (w/o or o/w), cosmetic products containing a proprietary Ec.-extract significantly reduced objective and subjective parameters in adults suffering from acute or chronic pruritus exhibiting excellent tolerability. </p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>Pruritus is a frequent and dominant symptom in many inflammatory skin diseases, for example, atopic eczema, psoriasis, <a href="#b1-ccid-11-591">1</a>, <a href="#b2-ccid-11-591">2</a> while dry skin condition (xerosis cutis) can cause or aggravate pruritus. <a href="#b3-ccid-11-591">3</a> Pruritus can be localized or generalized, and it can occur as acute or chronic (when lasting more than 6 weeks). <a href="#b4-ccid-11-591">4</a>, <a href="#b5-ccid-11-591">5</a> In addition, itch can be classified according to its origin as cutaneous (pruritoceptive), neuropathic, neurogenic, and psychogenic. <a href="#b4-ccid-11-591">4</a>, <a href="#b6-ccid-11-591">6</a> Classically, histamine has been recognized as a mediator of itch, especially of acute pruritus. However, over the last years additional mediators (serotonin, substance P, bradykinin, interleukin 13, and interleukin 31, toll like receptor 7) have been implicated in pruritus, nevertheless, the pathophysiology behind chronic pruritus is still not well understood. <a href="#b7-ccid-11-591">7</a>– <a href="#b10-ccid-11-591">10</a> Due to the strong association of pruritus with dry skin, topical therapy using emollients or moisturizers is very often the treatment of choice to replenish lipids and rehydrate the stratum corneum. <a href="#b3-ccid-11-591">3</a>, <a href="#b11-ccid-11-591">11</a> The aim for topical therapy of dry skin (xerosis cutis) or dry skin due to underlying skin diseases should thus be twofold: to repair the skin barrier and in addition to exhibit antipruritic effects, usually through addition of cosmetic or pharmacological active ingredients. <a href="#b3-ccid-11-591">3</a> </p> <p>Water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions are usually more effective than oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions since they replenish lipids to an impaired stratum corneum, which in turn reduces transepidermal water loss and thus w/o emulsions are a better choice for the treatment of very dry (xerotic) or atopic skin. <a href="#b12-ccid-11-591">12</a> </p> <p>As recently shown in a 3-month clinical trial, a w/o emulsion containing a proprietary <i>Echinacea purpurea</i> (Ec) root extract (Ec.-extract) significantly reduced the local SCORAD and pruritus in patients with subacute or chronic atopic eczema (AE). <a href="#b13-ccid-11-591">13</a> Moreover, in contrast to a comparator product, improvements in AE symptoms lasted for up to 85 days (12 weeks) suggesting that beneficial effects of treatment with w/o emulsion containing Ec.-extract is beyond lipid replenishing and rehydration effects and could be due to anti-inflammatory effect of the extract. <a href="#b13-ccid-11-591">13</a> </p> <p>In order to assess whether a w/o emulsion containing Ec.-extract is safe and efficacious in treating other types of pruritus, not associated with AE, and affecting larger body surfaces, a study with adult patients suffering from either acute or chronic pruritus was performed. </p> <p>In addition to pruritus of the body, a dry and itchy scalp is a very common complaint due to various causes (dermatologic, neuropathic, systemic, and psychogenic). <a href="#b14-ccid-11-591">14</a> </p> <p>Since a w/o emulsion is not cosmetically acceptable for scalp application, a novel o/w emulsion containing the Ec.-extract was developed particularly for the treatment of a dry and itchy scalp, and its efficacy was tested in a second clinical study. Furthermore, we investigated the cosmetic acceptance and properties of a shampoo containing the Ec.-extract in participants with chronically itchy and a normal-to-dry scalp or scalp prone to eczema in a third study. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Study to assess efficacy of the w/o emulsion containing Ec.-extract in adults suffering from pruritus </div> <div class="methods" title="methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Study design</div> <p>This open, nonrandomized, and noncontrolled study in adults suffering from acute pruritus (lasting less than 6 weeks) or chronic pruritus (lasting longer than 6 weeks) investigated a w/o emulsion with lipophilic Ec.-extract (Linola <sup>®</sup> Plus Lotion, Dr August Wolff GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG Arzneimittel, Germany; INCI: aqua, decyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, carthamus tinctorius seed oil, hexyldecanol, hexyldecyl laurate, glycerin, polyglyceryl-3 polyricinoleate, sorbitan isostearate, citrus aurantium dulcis peel cera, zinc stearate, benzyl alcohol, magnesium sulfate, Ec.-extract, lecithin, tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate, glyceryl oleate, glyceryl stearate, citric acid). The study protocol as well as other essential documents was approved by the Freiburg ethics commission international (feci code 017/1042) and was registered on <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a> registry with registration number NCT03477058. </p> <p>Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years; sex ~25%–50% male and 50%–75% female; complaining of unspecific pruritus (max. 50% with acute pruritus [lasts less than 6 weeks] and at least 50% with chronic pruritus [lasts longer than 6 weeks]); phototype I–IV; in general good health and mental condition; personal informed consents of the subjects to participate in the study; personal presence on the predefined days at the institute; willing and capable to follow the study rules and a fixed schedule. </p> <p>Of 55 participants included in the study, 18 (33%) were male and 37 (67%) female. Participants were between 20.2 and 78.6 years of age (average: 57.4 ± 13.3 years) with 95% of the participants suffering from chronic pruritus, while 5% suffered from acute pruritus. Exclusion criteria included patients with AE, individuals using topical medication in the test area within 1 month, systemic medication with immunomodulators, and/or chemotherapeutic agents within 4 weeks and systemic medication with antibiotics or a change in the medication with anti-inflammatory agents within 2 weeks before starting the study, individuals with severe disorders within the last 12 months (cancer, dialysis patients) or with immunological disorders, pregnancy and breastfeeding, individuals participating in other studies on the body concurrently to this study or during the last 2 weeks before starting the study and individuals participating in a study with a pharmaceutical preparation within a period of at least 4 weeks prior to this study. Participants were selected in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP guidelines and had to sign an informed consent before study entry. </p> <p>Prior to the start of the study and during the study period, participants had to follow standardized instructions regarding skin care. At least 7 days beforehand and during the study period, participants had to refrain from changing their skin care and cleansing habits on body and face and from using peelings on the body. Twenty-four hours before the study, participants had to refrain from using any leave-on product on the body (excluding face). During the entire study, no other leave-on products than the test products were to be used, including oily skin cleansing products and peelings. </p> <p>The product was applied at least once daily over a period of 2 weeks on the entire body and facultatively on the face. There were two assessment time points: at baseline (t0) and after 2 weeks of treatment (t1). Before assessments, participants acclimatized for at least 15 minutes at 21.5°C and 50% relative humidity and remained indoors until all assessments were completed. </p> <p>A board-certified dermatologist evaluated the skin tolerance of the product regarding erythema, edema, dryness, papules, pustules, and fissures on both arms and legs at the start of the study and after 2 weeks of product application. </p> <p>In addition, the dermatologist asked the participants to assess the sensory parameters of pruritus either burning or tension on arms and legs. At baseline, participants were requested to make their assessment based on the last 7 days before the start of the study. At the assessment after 2 weeks of product use, they were asked to consider the entire treatment period.

Study design</div> <p>This open, nonrandomized, and noncontrolled study in adults suffering from dry, itchy scalp prone to AE or atopic dermatitis investigated a low fat o/w emulsion containing a lipophilic Ec. extract (WO 4260; INCI: aqua, propanediol, isostearic acid, isostearyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, Ec.- extract, carthamus tinctorius seed oil, isopropyl myristate, squalene, sodium polyacrylate, cetyl stearate, ethylhexyl cocoate, isostearyl isostearate, ethylhexylglycerin, cetyl alcohol, potassium cetyl phosphate, PPG-3 benzyl ether myristate, stearic acid, polysorbate 20). The study protocol as well as other essential documents was approved by the Freiburg ethics commission international (feci code 017/1035) and was registered on <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a> registry with registration number NCT03252730. Participants had to be users of hair tonic for dry scalp. Further inclusion criteria for the scalp studies were following: age ≥ 18 years; sex: ~50% male and ~50% female; dry, itchy scalp prone to AE/atopic dermatitis; phototype I–IV; in general good health and mental condition; personal informed consents of the subjects to participate in the study; personal presence on the predefined days at the institute; willing and capable to follow the study rules and a fixed schedule. Of 33 participants included in this study, 16 (48%) were male and 17 (52%) were female. Participants were between 24.7 and 69.2 years old (on average 49.2 ± 12.4 years). </p> <p>Exclusion criteria were similar to those in the first study with following additions: users of sour hair rinse and other dermatological disorders on the scalp. Participants were selected in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP guidelines and had to sign an informed consent before study entry. </p> <p>The product was applied to the scalp once daily in the evening over a 4-week period. Prior to and during the course of the study, participants had to follow instructions regarding skin and hair care: at least 7 days before the start of the study and during the study they had to refrain from changing their shampoo and hair care products such as conditioner, serum, and hair masks. Participants had to refrain from washing their hair until the next morning. On the days of the visit, participants were requested to wash the hair at least 3 hours before the visit, at the same time for all visits. No hair styling products were to be used when visiting the study center. </p> <p>Assessment time points were at baseline (t0) and after 2 (t1) and 4 (t2) weeks of treatment. Before each assessment, participants stayed in a climatized room with 21.5°C and 50% relative humidity for at least 15 minutes and they remained indoors until all assessments were completed.

At the beginning of the study, pruritus intensity ranged from slight to very strong, with 53% reporting a clearly perceptible pruritus and 24% a strong or very strong pruritus. The 2-week application of the w/o emulsion containing Ec. extract led to a clear change in the pruritus intensity: strong pruritus was down to 2% and clearly perceptible pruritus down to 15%. The majority of participants had no perceptible pruritus (62%) or very slightly perceptible pruritus (18%) after using w/o emulsion containing Ec.-extract for 2 weeks ( <a href="#f1-ccid-11-591">Figure 1</a>). </p> <p>Overall, the questionnaire-based self-assessment showed a reduction of pruritus for 93% of the participants, which is in good accordance with the results obtained from the interviews conducted by the dermatologist. </p> <p>At the same time, pruritus burden was also reduced. At the start of the study, 98% of the participants reported a burden due to pruritus and nearly half (47%) rated the burden as being strong or very strong. This proportion was down to 2% after the 2-week treatment, while 87% of the participants found the pruritus no longer disturbing or even noted no burden at all. The mean score for pruritus burden decreased from 3.5 to 1.6 ( <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001) on a scale from 1 (none) to 6 (unbearable). In total, 91% of the participants had a reduced pruritus burden. </p> <p>Further, the duration of pruritus was shortened. At baseline the duration of pruritus was assessed as short term (40%) or hourly (49%) by most of the participants and constant pruritus was reported by 11%. After 2 weeks of treatment, pruritus was not present in 34 out of 55 (62%) of the participants. The remaining participants mostly assessed the duration of pruritus as only short term (35%).

Discussion</div> <p>Pruritus may be only a symptom but is a significant burden on quality of life caused by different skin diseases (eg, atopic dermatitis, xerosis cutis, psoriasis, or different systemic diseases, eg, liver disease, kidney failure). Once the cause of pruritus is known, a specific therapy can be induced. However, very often pruritus is chronic, and there is a need for effective medical skin care to reduce the burden of existing pruritus. Previous studies using a w/o emulsion containing a Ec.-extract significantly reduced AE symptoms including pruritus. <a href="#b13-ccid-11-591">13</a> Furthermore, the emulsion showed excellent tolerability. Thus, the aim was to test whether this Ec.-extract in different formulations may be used efficiently to treat larger body surfaces (and not only AE lesions), and whether it reliefs acute and chronic pruritus in adults not associated with AE. </p> <p>Indeed, after application of the w/o emulsion containing <i>E. purpurea</i> root extract for 2 weeks, adults reported significant improvements regarding pruritus intensity and burden. </p> <p>In agreement with the self-assessment by participants, interviews conducted by a dermatologist confirmed reduction of pruritus, burning, and tension. In addition, erythema and skin dryness were significantly reduced after using the Ec.-extract containing w/o-emulsion for 2 weeks. Finally, patients were satisfied with the cosmetic properties of the product. </p> <p>In the second, separate study, a newly developed low fat o/w emulsion containing the Ec.-extract was tested on the dry and itchy scalp. Four week use of the product significantly decreased erythema, dryness, scaling, and papules on the scalp. Dandruff was also reduced and the majority of the participants also experienced a significant antipruritic effect of the emulsion. The percentage of participants benefiting from the regular use of the hair tonic was still increasing between week 2 and 4, which suggests beneficial long-term effects. The observed changes in skin hydration on the scalp (overall improvement with a reduction between baseline and the first assessment time-point at week 2) are difficult to interpret, as the study design did not include an untreated control. Considering the challenges of treating scalp pruritus <a href="#b15-ccid-11-591">15</a> the improvements documented here, with 79% of participants reporting an improvement after 2 weeks and 85% after 4 weeks of treatment, provide evidence that products containing this Ec.-extract are a promising additional treatment in the challenging setting of scalp pruritus because in case of hairy scalp, well-known barrier restoring effects of a w/o emulsion cannot be applied. This low-fat o/w emulsion containing Ec.-extract used by patients suffering from scalp pruritus exhibited in addition to its efficacy good cosmetic properties according to the questionnaire. Similar results regarding reduction of dryness and pruritus of the scalp were also obtained by the use of the shampoo containing Ec.-extract. Future study using both products (shampoo and o/w emulsion) will show whether beneficial effect can be further improved. </p> <p>Antipruritic effects exhibited by plant extracts are described in the literature. A cream containing the birch bark extract betulin (Imlan <sup>®</sup> Creme; Amryt AG, Niefern-Öschelbronn, Germany) reduced pruritus in 52.7% of participants. <a href="#b16-ccid-11-591">16</a> The effects were strongly pronounced in participants who had pruritus due to dermatosis and participants with chronic scratch lesions. In the previous study, the used birch bark extract cream served as comparator product to the product containing Ec.-extract. Although both products reduced AE symptoms, effects seen with the birch bark extract containing cream diminished after 2 months, while the effects seen with Ec.-extract emulsion were persistent for up to 85 days, pointing to an anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effect of the Ec.-extract and not an emollient effect only. <a href="#b13-ccid-11-591">13</a> </p> <p>A split-scalp study on 30 individuals with itchy scalp investigated an aqueous leave-on tonic (EUCERIN <sup>®</sup>-Dermo-Capillaire; Beiersdorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) containing multiple active ingredients including <i>Glycyrrhiza inflata</i> root extract (with licochalcone A as active ingredient). Treatment was performed only in a hair studio at the test center and trained study personnel applied the tonic to one side of the scalp and left the other side untreated. Under these controlled conditions participants reported reduction of scalp pruritus and reduction of scalp dryness. <a href="#b17-ccid-11-591">17</a> Moreover, initially postulated as treatment goal, there was no effect on the lipid content, but a clear reduction of free fatty acids was shown which could point to suboptimal barrier restoring effects. <a href="#b17-ccid-11-591">17</a> In addition, a recent study investigating a emulsion containing pseudo-ceramide and eucalyptus extract showed effectively improved dry and scaly scalp as well as the quality of life of 34 participants with different skin conditions (atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, pityriasis capitis). <a href="#b18-ccid-11-591">18</a> </p> <p>In contrast to the published study in atopic individuals, the objective and subjective effects seen in the two studies presented here (skin pruritus &amp;gt;90% of participants; scalp pruritus 85% of participants) confirm that the Ec.-extract containing cosmetic products provide a treatment for both pruritic skin and itchy scalp independent from the vehicle (w/o or o/w). The beneficial clinical effects shown in the previous <a href="#b13-ccid-11-591">13</a> and current studies are further supported by recent findings that Ec.-extract inhibits mast cell degranulation. <a href="#b19-ccid-11-591">19</a> It might be speculated that Ec.-extract through its action on mast cells inhibits release of histamine, or other substance which subsequently might reduce pruritus. <a href="#b20-ccid-11-591">20</a>– <a href="#b22-ccid-11-591">22</a> </p> <p>In addition to Ec.-extract, both the w/o emulsion and low fat o/w emulsion in this study contained linoleic acid, which may provide additional benefits for the regeneration of the skin barrier. Linoleic acid is well known to be essential for the epidermal permeability barrier, <a href="#b23-ccid-11-591">23</a>, <a href="#b24-ccid-11-591">24</a> and it has been shown that oils with a higher linoleic acid to oleic acid ratio have better barrier repair potential. <a href="#b25-ccid-11-591">25</a> Furthermore, it was shown that the combination of linoleic acid and Ec.-extract is beneficial for barrier regeneration. The comparison to a preparation without Ec.-extract revealed that the positive effect is not purely emollient based, indicating synergistic effects of combining linoleic acid and Ec.-extracts in one product. <a href="#b13-ccid-11-591">13</a> </p> <p>Topically applied products to alleviate pruritus not only should provide an antipruritic effect but also have to meet customer expectations of medical skin care, in particular regarding the cosmetic properties. The tested w/o emulsion and low-fat o/w emulsions met both needs by providing very good antipruritic effects and achieving a high user satisfaction regarding their cosmetic properties. Further, it is important to achieve a beneficial effect on a short time scale, as it is commonly felt that users must appreciate noticeable improvements within 14 days in order not to discontinue product use. <a href="#b26-ccid-11-591">26</a> The tested w/o emulsion achieved an effect already after first treatment in more than two-third (69%) of the patients, and even 79% of patients reported significant reduction of pruritus within the first 2 weeks of using the hair tonic. </p> <div class="limitations" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Limitations</div> <p>Finally, we are aware that our study has limitations. Due to the fact that the investigated products are cosmetic products, the studies presented here did not include a control without Ec.-extract and thus improvement of skin condition and reduction of pruritus seen in the studies may be due to effects of the entire cosmetic product. However, since the formulations where significantly different, w/o versus o/w versus shampoo, an effect primarily exhibited by the Ec.-extract at least for the o/w and shampoo is very likely, as shown recently for the w/o emulsion. <a href="#b13-ccid-11-591">13</a> All of our current studies covered maximally 4 weeks of use, so whether a longer-term use would result in additional or continued beneficial effects needs to be investigated. </p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p>The studies presented here investigated the use of medical skin care products containing a Ec.-extract in adults suffering from pruritus of different causes, but not related to AD of either body or scalp. Our results show that the application of either a w/o emulsion or a low-fat o/w emulsion containing Ec.-extract significantly reduced pruritus on body and scalp. In addition, the improvement was noticeable already after the first treatment and further improved within 14 days of product use. Based on the achieved antipruritic effect within 2 weeks and the good cosmetic properties, these medical skin care products show promise as adjuvant therapy to alleviate pruritus of body or scalp independent from underlying causes. </p> </div> <div class="supplementary-material" title="supplementary-material"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
