They regard it as a tribal symbol and a gift of love. Fleagrass also has many medicinal uses, and there is considerable potential for its development as an insect repellent. Traditionally, Akha people plant it in swidden fields, but there are few swidden fields in China now. Therefore, the first question this study aims to answer is as follows: how is fleagrass planted and utilized now? At present, fleagrass is only reported to be used by Akha people in Mengla. We also try to understand the following questions: Is fleagrass used in nearby area? If so, how is fleagrass used in nearby area? Furthermore, why is fleagrass used in that way?</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">From August 2016 to July 2018, field surveys were conducted six times. The ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological uses of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>buchneroides</italic> in 13 Akha villages were investigated by means of semi-structured interviews. We assessed the responses of a total of 64 interviewees (32 men and 32 women; mean age, 58.6) from the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, southwest China, and from Phongsaly Province, Laos. To explain the bases for the ethnobotanical uses of fleagrass, we used Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to review the bioactivities of the chemical constituents of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>buchneroides.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">With the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products, fleagrass cultivation is disappearing in China. However, most Akha people in Xishuangbanna still remember and yearn for its traditional uses, and Akha people in a nearby area (northern Laos) continue to plant and utilize it. We documented ten uses of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>buchneroides</italic> within five discrete categories<italic>.</italic> The whole plant of fleagrass has a distinct strong aroma, of which Akha villagers are particularly fond. Akha villagers mostly use this aromatic property as a decoration, perfume, and insect repellent. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>buchneroides</italic> is also used as a condiment and for medicinal and ritual purposes, including its use as a cure for insect bites, headaches, influenza, and diarrhoea, and as a part of pray ritual for a bumper harvest. From our literature review, we identified many major chemical compounds contained in the essential oil of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>buchneroides</italic>, including thymol, carvacrol, 3-carene, and <italic>p</italic>-cymene, which have insecticidal or insect-repellent, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Fleagrass is an aromatic plant that is widely used by Aka people. Its chemical composition also has a variety of biological activities. With the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products, fleagrass utilization in China is disappearing and its cultural importance is reduced. However, its economic and medicinal value is assignable.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13002-018-0277-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31670337</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Plant Germplasm Resources Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>ZSZC-012</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Vector-borne diseases pose a significant threat to human life and welfare and account for approximately 17% of the global burden of infectious diseases, causing more than one million deaths each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More than 80% of the world&#x02019;s population live in areas with at least one major vector-borne disease risk, with more than half of the population facing two or more such risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For most vector-borne diseases, prevention by targeting vectors is the first and best approach. Use of long clothing and topical repellents for personal protection is one of proven effective vector control approaches. When considering the adverse environmental effects and the development of resistance to synthetic repellents, there is currently a greater requirement for plant-based repellents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">People have been combatting insects for thousands, even millions, of years. Several species of primates have been observed rubbing plants to repel insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The earliest recorded human use of plants as a repellent can be traced back to BC. Herodotus recorded that Egyptian fishermen burn castor oil in oil lamps to repel mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the Chinese ancient book &#x02018;Zhou Li&#x02019; (one of four extant collections of ritual matters of the Zhou Dynasty, 1046&#x02009;B.C. to 256&#x02009;B.C.), there is a record of burning plants to fumigate insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the Arribes del Duero (western Spain), local residents reported 27 traditional uses of 22 plants to prevent or control mosquitoes, flies, and other insects. Of the 27 reported remedies, inhabitants of the area continue to use 16 (59%), mainly against mosquitoes and houseflies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Boer et al. conducted structured interviews in 66 villages of 17 ethnic groups, throughout the Lao People&#x02019;s Democratic Republic. A total of 92 plant species was recorded to repel or kill hematophagous arthropods, including mosquitoes, bedbugs, human lice, mites and ticks, fly larvae, and blood-sucking leeches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Africa, some places are the hardest hit areas by insect-borne diseases, where&#x000a0;local residents still apply plants in traditional ways as an effective and economical means of insect control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Peasants of all regions knew well how to use specific local plants to protect themselves against insects. They named some of them according to the insect for which they were used to repel. For instance, almost all species in the genus <italic>Polygonum</italic> have the same local name, kirburohi, or &#x02018;flea herb&#x02019; in Estonian scientific nomenclature, which is because these species are used exclusively against human fleas. The whole plant was cut, dried, and then placed on the floor or in the bed to kill fleas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, some special plants are endowed with special cultural meanings. A typical example is <italic>Artemisia vulgaris</italic>, which is hung on the door as part of a ceremony to drive away pests and diseases for the Dragon Boat Festival. In rural China, the burning of bundles of dried <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> to produce smoke had been used to repel insects for centuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. After the Dragon Boat Festival, the weather starts to heat up, and the snake worms and ants began to move. Therefore, people usually put a branch of <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> at their doorsteps to ward off diseases, prevent mosquitoes, and ward off evil spirits. Although modern products have replaced traditional protection, this ritual continues today.</p><p id="Par10">In Mengla County of China, there is also a plant named &#x02018;fleagrass&#x02019;, <italic>Adenosma buchneroides</italic>. Similar to the <italic>Polygonum</italic> in Estonia, fleagrass is an insect-repellent plant that is used by the Akha people. However, fleagrass plays a broader and more important role in the culture of Akha. Akha people wear it on the head every day, because they like the smell and regard it as the symbol of Akha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The smell is also good for relaxing and comforting the body. In traditional Akha medicine, the whole plant has medicinal value in anti-rheumatic, diminishing swelling, dissipate stasis, and analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The essential oil of fleagrass exhibited a good reduction of the population of adult insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Chemical constituents of the essential oil of fleagrass have been identified, with 39 chemical compounds reported. The main constituents include thymol, carvacrol, 3-carene, <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and &#x003b2;-phellandrene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

In each village, we held the first meeting with the village chief and his advisors to inform them of the purpose of our work. The village head would consent to the research and recommend traditional healers or herbalists to be interviewed for the study. Furthermore, we also interviewed some other informants who were elderly villagers or had a sound knowledge of fleagrass. With the assistance of a guide who can speak Lao, Akha, and Chinese, we also selected three Akha villages in Phongsaly Province, Laos, where they still cultivate fleagrass. In the villages of Laos, we selected informants randomly. A voucher specimen (KUN: 1341141), which was deposited in the herbarium of the Kunming Institute of Botany, China (KUN), was used as a representative sample of the plant for identification by respondents.

Fleagrass is also regarded as a ritual plant, and the Akha hang bundles of fleagrass in their granaries as an offering in hope of a bumper harvest.</p><p id="Par26">Akha swidden farmers of China and Laos have similar cultivation experiences. They cultivate fleagrass together with upland rice as an inter-cropping system. Fleagrass seeds are planted simultaneously with dry rice seeds in April (the beginning of the rainy season), although in different holes in the fields. Fleagrass plant growth is slower than that of rice plants, and thus, fleagrass plants are always below a canopy of rice foliage, which inhibits fleagrass growth. Swidden farmers harvest rice from fields in October, at which time the fleagrass is flowering. With the rice harvested, the fleagrass is exposed to considerably more sunlight, and the open field conditions are favourable for pollination. When the fleagrass fruits are sufficiently mature, they are harvested for family use. However, with the continuing disappearance of swidden agriculture in China, there are only a few people who still plant fleagrass. Considering the requirement for shade, fleagrass is now planted together with tea trees. The Akha typically collect dried plants bearing seeds, the bundles of which are hung around their homes. The seeds are separated in the following year and subsequently planted. Generally, each family grows fleagrass annually in a small plot of upland rice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Cultural meanings and beliefs associated with fleagrass</title><p id="Par27">The Akha people like the scent of fleagrass and often wear fresh or dried branches on their heads as decoration and perfume. Other ethnic groups, including other swidden groups such as the Jino, Yao, Miao, and Lahu, within the same area do not use fleagrass. The Akha people regard it as a tribal symbol, which indicates that they are different from other tribes. Because this kind of grass is only planted and used by the Akha people, when they wear the fleas on the head, they also have a sense of pride and belonging. Akha villagers make use of fleagrass as decorations and perfume in different styles according to age, sexuality, and tribal identity. Elders among the Akha villagers use fleagrass in small bundles to wear in their ear-holes or only in the right ear-hole as a decoration and perfume. Akha women wear a small bundle of fleagrass attached to their colourful woman&#x02019;s cap. However, Akha men and little boys and little girls do not usually make use of fleagrass as a decoration.</p><p id="Par28">Akha young men and women enjoy full social freedom. Each village has a &#x02018;public house&#x02019; that is dedicated to providing space for young people to have parties and dates. Unmarried men and women can go to the public house to sing, dance, play, and talk to each other about love. When the young girl or boy comes to date, he or she will wear the fleagrass on his or her head as a sign. The girls put a bunch of fleagrass on the laces of their hats. The boys also wear a bunch of fleagrass on their ears. The scent of fleagrass makes the public house full of pleasant, fragrant tastes and provides a romantic atmosphere. When a young person falls for someone, they will also give &#x02018;fleas grass&#x02019; as a gift of love.</p><p id="Par29">Traditionally, the Akha have been a migratory people who practice swidden (slash and burn) agriculture. The mountain crops mainly include upland rice, corn, and cotton. The Akha plant fleagrass together with upland rice as an inter-cropping system. When the rice matures, the Akha harvest it and store the rice in the barn. At the same time, they pick up a bunch of fleagrass that is hanging outside the barn. This is a ritual that is used to pray for stored crops without insects and for the crops of the upcoming year to be bumper harvested without pests and disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>The rise and fall of fleagrass in China</title><p id="Par30">Previously, there was no record of <italic>A. buchneroides</italic> in China, until Shen et al. (1991) found that fleagrass was introduced into swidden cultivating systems by Akha people in the Xishuangbanna area and served as a useful plant a long time ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Because the Akha people do not have tribal scripts, their knowledge of plant uses is passed on verbally, and thus, there is no written record about fleagrass in China in ancient times. When and how the Hani began their domestication of the plant in the area remains uncertain.</p><p id="Par31">In China, someone said the Akha name of fleagrass &#x02018;Lao-wo-suo-du&#x02019; means &#x02018;grass that is from Laos&#x02019;; &#x02018;Lao wo&#x02019; means Laos in Chinese. Two informants reported a legend about the name. A short man brought fleagrass from Laos, and he sent it to the local people, but the local people did not take it because they did not know what it was. Then, the short man spread it everywhere, and there was abundant fleagrass in the field. Thus, they call it &#x02018;Lao-wo-suo-do&#x02019;. This legend may explain how fleagrass came to China from Laos. However, current wild distribution of fleagrass occurs only in Vietnam. It is still unclear how fleagrass spread from Vietnam.</p><p id="Par32"><italic>A</italic>. <italic>buchneroides</italic> was first described in &#x02018;Bulletin de la Soci&#x000e9;t&#x000e9; Botanique de Gen&#x000e8;ve&#x02019; in 1913 by Bonati, who collected specimens in Vietnam and introduced <italic>A. buchneroides</italic> as an aromatic plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, &#x02018;Flore Du Cambodge, Du Laos, Et Du Vietnam&#x02019;, &#x02018;Checklist of Plant Species of Vietnam&#x02019;, &#x02018;Flora Yunnan&#x02019; and &#x02018;Flora of Thailand&#x02019; do not recognize <italic>A. buchneroides</italic> as an individual species, they all regard it as a synonym of <italic>A. indianum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. <italic>A. buchneroides</italic> and <italic>A. indianum</italic> have the same Vietnamese name &#x02018;Bobo&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. <italic>A. indianum</italic> is also a Chinese medicine, and Chinese residents use it to cure colds, headaches, fevers, bellyaches, diarrhoea, cacochylia, and dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These uses are similar with the uses for <italic>A. buchneroides</italic>. <italic>A. buchneroides</italic> and <italic>A. indianum</italic> have many similarities, but they also have some differences. The flowers of <italic>A. buchneroides</italic> and <italic>A. indianum</italic> densely connate and formatted into terminal or capitate spikes, but the inflorescence of <italic>A. buchneroides</italic> is longer than that of <italic>A. indianum</italic>.</p><p id="Par33">Therefore, there are two hypotheses about the origin of fleagrass. Maybe it was disseminated from Vietnam through Laos to China. It is also possible that fleagrass was domesticated from <italic>A. indianum</italic>, and the inflorescence became longer in the process of cultivating. Testing these hypotheses requires more in-depth investigations and molecular evidence.</p><p id="Par34">No matter how it begins, the current situation of fleagrass is not optimistic. With the continuing population growth and the introduction of cash crops and new policies, swidden agriculture in China is being replaced and is disappearing. Therefore, the resource of fleagrass is in danger of vanishing, particularly in China. Moreover, with improvements in the living standards of the Akha people, modern goods are increasingly replacing traditional materials. Therefore, the importance of fleagrass in Akha villages is declining, and with this decline, the traditional knowledge of fleagrass is becoming lost. Through field surveys, we accessed a total of 45 interviewees from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Southwest China. There are 31 interviewees who have knowledge of a plant called fleagrass (or &#x02018;lao-wo-suo-du&#x02019; in the Akha dialect) with morphological features as presented to them during the survey. Most of them have not cultivated fleagrass since 1990, when they began the large-scale planting of rubber. The significance of fleagrass in Akha traditional culture is therefore likely to die with reduced resources. An overwhelming majority of the young generation of Akha claim that they never see this plant and do not know about it. During the survey, we found only three people who continue to use fleagrass today. They save seeds and plant them in small scale, and they use fleagrass mostly in perfumes, to repel insects and alleviate insect bites, while other medical uses have been replaced by modern medicine.</p><p id="Par35">Although fleagrass has died down from the daily life of the Akha people in China, they still remember the uses of fleagrass, and they yearn for it. When we showed the plant to the Akha people, they were happy and wanted to replant it. In the process of modernization, they accidentally lost fleagrass. However, fleagrass is able to occupy an important position again, as long as they are given the opportunity to replant it.</p><p id="Par36">Compared to China, Akha of Laos still retain swidden agriculture, and the fleagrass resources are preserved. Considering the economic conditions and the convenience of life in Laos, the life of the Akhas is still heavily dependent on the resources of the forest plants, so the traditional knowledge of the fleagrass has been preserved. In Laos, each of the 19 interviewees we accessed know and use fleagrass now, and the mean age is 43&#x02009;years old, which is younger than that of the respondents of China.</p><p id="Par37">In conclusion, we think the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products are the main reasons why fleagrass in China is disappearing. Nevertheless, we found that few Akha people of China continue to use fleagrass in perfume, to repel insects and to alleviate insect bites. Therefore, we think that fleagrass is effective at repelling insects and alleviating insect bites, but it is not widely known.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>The scientific basis of folk usages</title><p id="Par38">Shen et al.

Traditionally, Akha villagers placed bundles of fleagrass in their rooms or caps and utilized the aroma to repel insects. The Akha villagers of Laos hung fleagrass on the wall of granaries and planted it in the field to protect the grains from grain pests which benefits the crop harvest. Therefore, they used fleagrass to pray for a bumper harvest. However, the Akha live in a humid tropical mountainous region where insect bites cannot be completely avoided. Such bites are often accompanied by swelling, itching, and even secondary infection. Like many other traditional plants used to treat itching skin, the mechanism of fleagrass is used to treat insect bites. Nevertheless, the analgesic activity of carvacrol and the anti-inflammatory activity of several chemicals are helpful in relieving pain and preventing infection.</p><p id="Par41">Some aromatic compounds, such as pinene, can be used as relaxants to reduce fatigue and thus may have a beneficial aromatherapeutic effect. Akha villagers are accordingly fond of using fleagrass as a fragrance. Thymol, one of the main constituents, exhibited high anti-viral activity, which may be useful in relieving headache, stuffy nose, and influenza.</p><p id="Par42">Fleagrass is also used as a food condiment by the Akha of northern Laos. In addition to its odour and taste, we believe that this use may be related to the plant&#x02019;s content of antimicrobial compounds. Temperatures in the regions inhabited by the Akha are generally high, and people like to eat raw materials; thus, there may be plenty of microorganisms in the food. The antibacterial and fungicide activities of fleagrass are helpful in keeping food fresh and safe to consume.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">Fleagrass is a versatile aromatic plant that is traditionally planted in swidden fields by the Akha people. With the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products, fleagrass in China is disappearing, and its cultural importance has been reduced. However, its economic and medicinal value is assignable. On the basis of an ethnobotanical survey of fleagrass in northern Laos and in China, we documented the Akha villagers&#x02019; use of fleagrass as a perfume, insect repellent, condiment, herbal medicine, and ritualistic plant. To the best of our knowledge, we report here for the first time that Akha villagers crush fresh fleagrass and apply it to the skin to treat insect bites, and the Akha in northern Laos eat the fresh leaves of fleagrass as a flavouring. Furthermore, they hang bundles of fleagrass in their granaries as a ritualistic offering in the hope of a bumper harvest. From our literature review, we identified chemical constituents of the essential oil of fleagrass that have good bioactivities related to antimicrobial, sterilization, insecticidal, insect repellent, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral properties. Overall, we consider that fleagrass is a multi-functional plant with tribal characteristics, particularly with respect to its use as an insect repellent and in the treatment of insect bites.</p><p id="Par44">Although some of the aforementioned folk uses can be assigned tentatively to the bioactivities of certain chemical constituents that are found in fleagrass, further targeted research is warranted in this respect. As a traditional insect repellent, further in-depth research on fleagrass may help us to develop new, effective plant-based repellents. In addition, with continuing economic development and environmental changes, the resources and traditional knowledge of fleagrass are in danger of vanishing. As an important plant resource, we should focus on the protection and exploitation of fleagrass. We therefore highlight the need for further research that focuses particularly on the cultivation of fleagrass, the biological activities of its essential oil or extracts, the mechanisms underlying its various activities, and product development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
