In contraposition, new studies reveal that fatty acids have an essential role for human health. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the clinical applications of fatty acids present in sea buckthorn oil. The composition of fatty acids found in sea buckthorn (<italic>Hippophae rhamnoides)</italic> oil is unique for this species, presenting a vast range of health benefits for humans and therefore it is highly valued by both biomedicine and the cosmetic industry. In this way, we will see the clinical effect of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids that constitute sea buckthorn oil and how they contribute to the correct function of the organism. Despite there being studies that support the positive effects of sea buckthorn fatty acids, they are limited. Hence, most of the results obtained in this review are from studies of isolated fatty acids instead of fatty acids extracted from sea buckthorn oil. These facts permit to demonstrate the effect of sea buckthorn fatty acids separately but we lost the possibility of detecting a synergic effect of all of them. More studies are necessary to certify the clinical application of the fatty acids present in sea buckthorn oil as well as discovering possible synergies between them.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fatty acids</kwd><kwd>Sea buckthorn</kwd><kwd>Omega-3</kwd><kwd>Omega-6</kwd><kwd>Clinical applications</kwd><kwd>Human health</kwd><kwd>Plant</kwd><kwd>Omega-7</kwd><kwd><italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic></kwd><kwd>Omega-9</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par25">For several decades, the beneficial properties of fatty acids have been largely ignored. In contrast, this paper will review the contributions made by several researchers who have shed light over the fact that the fatty acid group is actually large and diverse, as well as greatly beneficial for human health.</p><p id="Par26">From a nutritional standpoint, fatty acids have an important role in several metabolic and structural functions. They are indispensable compounds of the cell membranes, are responsible for the transport of vitamins, and regulate the concentration of lipids in plasma. Furthermore, fatty acids produce a number of precursors such as eicosanoides, decosanoides, steroid hormones and biliary acid, all of them fundamental for the adequate functioning of the metabolism. In addition, they are the most important energetic nutrient &#x02013;it is currently recommended that at least 20% of the total energy intake should derive from lipids&#x02013;.</p><p id="Par27">As already mentioned, a number of studies have revealed that fatty acids are very diverse, each type of them having different effects over the organism. So far, the fatty acids found to be most beneficial are those presenting an even number of carbons (4 to 30) and instaurations, which are mainly found in marine species. However, lately it has also been highlighted that some plants, such as sea buckthorn, also contain abundant and valuable fatty acids (especially in their seeds) with high nutritional value, as well as useful for several clinical applications. In particular, sea buckthorn is a perfect natural vegetable source to obtain a wide range of fatty acids, especially essential and unsaturated fatty acids, both the most beneficial for human health. It is a plant that is composed of different bioactive compounds, which may also be found in other medicinal plants. The characteristic that makes sea buckthorn unique is the qualitative and quantitative composition of its fatty acids, particularly the presence of the fatty acid omega-7 group, higher than in any other plant.</p><p id="Par28">Sea buckthorn (<italic>Hippophae</italic>) is a hardy bush of the <italic>Elaegnaceae</italic> family classified into nine subspecies, from which <italic>Hipopphae rhamnoides L. subsp sinensis</italic> and <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides L. subsp rhamnoides</italic> are the most applied to commercial purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is a deciduous spiny species distributed all over the temperate zone of Asia and Europe, as well as over subtropical zones at high altitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Its products, particularly the oil obtained from the seed and the soft parts of the plant, contain an interesting composition of lipophilic compounds. In relation to the oil composition, sea buckthorn is characterized by a unique mixture of bioactive components, being one of them the fatty acids. In general, the oil obtained from seed is rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, while in the pulp oils are predominantly fatty acids from the omega-7 group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although the prevalence of fatty acids in the different parts is well established, there could be variations depending on the subspecies, harvesting time and method of isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several mechanisms of oil extraction are used, solvent extraction using hexane and supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> being the most common in industrial and laboratory scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In any case, several studies of fatty acids contained in sea buckthorn oil reveal that it may play an important role in very different aspects in relation to the human body, such as cardiovascular disorders, as a stimulator of the immune system, as well as promoting cognitive functions and bone health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, it may be important to improve various skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], acne skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Fatty acid composition of oils from seeds, whole berries and pulp/peel of Sea buckthorn of different origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Fatty acid</th><th>Seed (%)</th><th>Berry (%)</th><th>Pulp/peel (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td colspan="3">

Each of these subheadings explains in more detail the characteristics of the relevant fatty acid: its chemical structure, its proportion (%) in the oil and its effects over human health in order of significance.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Monounsaturated fatty acids</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Palmitoleic acid (PA)</title><p id="Par33">PA (16:1) is an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid very uncommon within the plant kingdom. Consequently, it is very difficult to introduce it in the human diet through vegetable food sources. Sea buckthorn is one of the few plants that present this fatty acid. Specifically, PA is only found in the soft part of the berry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. According to Yang &#x00026; Kallio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] the oil obtained from the pulp and peel of the sea buckthorn contains high levels of PA &#x02013;up to 43%&#x02013; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. On the contrary, the seed of the sea buckthorn presents extremely low levels of PA (&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5% of PA in triacilglicerol (TAG)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The composition of the fatty acid may be different according to its origin, subspecies or harvesting time. Some studies reveal that sea buckthorn originated in Central Asia and the Baltic region contained a higher proportion of PA in the TAG of the berry mescocarp than the ones originated in the Caucas. Another study compares the composition of omega-7 fatty acids in pulp/peel (palmitoleic and vaccenic acids) between the <italic>subsp. sinensis</italic> and <italic>subsp. rhamnoides,</italic> the latter presenting a higher proportion of it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, the proportion of vaccenic acid seed oil is very low compared to the rest of fatty acids (2&#x02013;5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Skin and mucous disorders</title><p id="Par34">Several researchers conclude that PA takes part in different mechanisms that improve skin and mucous disorders. The main positive effects of PA are resumed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Several studies emphasize the beneficial effects of PA for vaginal inflammatory atrophy treatment. Although an extensive range of treatments exist for this disorder &#x02013;such as systemic and local estrogens, local testosterone, systemic and local corticoids, retinoid, anti-inflammatory ointment or surgery&#x02013; these treatments are frequently inefficient. For this reason, alternative options such as the sea buckthorn application have been researched. For instance, a study published on Agro Food Industry Hi-Tech focuses on the oral administration of 3 capsules of omega-7 sea buckthorn to 5 patients twice a day during 12&#x02009;weeks. The results of the study show a considerable improvement of chronic vaginal inflammatory atrophy in three cases. However, in the two least severe cases the improvement was less obvious. The mechanisms of omega-7 did not take place through an increase of circulating estrogen level, and it could therefore be an alternative to this treatment. Nonetheless, the number of patients recruited was small and more clinical trials are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Effects of Palmitoleic acid in vivo and in vitro clinical trials</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Disorder</th><th>Study</th><th>Suggested mechanism</th><th>References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vaginal inflammatory atrophy</td><td>Human in vivo study</td><td>The mechanism is unknown but it reflects a positive increasing trend of the vaginal health index without an increase of circulating estrogen level</td><td><p>Erkkola &#x00026; Yang (2003) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]</p><p>Limo (2004)</p></td></tr><tr><td>Skin hyperpigmentation</td><td>In vitro study</td><td>Decrease hyperpigmentation though the Inhibition of tyrosinase, TRP-2 and MITF</td><td>Yoon (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Wounds infections</td><td>In vitro study</td><td><p>Take part in the growth of C.albicans</p><p>decreasing its ability of adhesion in the skin and prevent the attachment of pathogenic yeast cells.</p></td><td>Wille &#x00026; Kydonieus (2002)</td></tr><tr><td>Bacterial infection</td><td>In vitro study</td><td>PA calcium salt has a bactericidal effect against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. acnes.</italic></td><td>Yamamoto (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Hypercholesterolemia</td><td>Mice in vivo study</td><td><p>A possible mechanisms may</p><p>be related to the increase of LCAT</p></td><td>Budijanto (1992) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Diabetes and liver dysfunctions</td><td>Mice in vivo study</td><td>It stimulate the uptake glucose and impaired the lipogenesis in liver by activation of AMPk and FGF-21, depending on PPAR-&#x003b1;</td><td><p>Souza (2016)</p><p>Yang &#x00026; Zhi-Hong (2010)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par35">Another study focusing on the vaginal inflammatory atrophy suggested a daily oral intake of 3&#x02009;g of sea buckthorn oil, where the main fatty acid was PA (24%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A total of 116 postmenopausal women were randomized into two groups: in the first one they were administered sea buckthorn, while in the second one they were administered placebo. The results of the study indicate a positive increasing trend of the vaginal health index for the sea buckthorn group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the ability of PA is thought to inhibit melanogenesis. The melanogenesis is the synthesis of melanocyts, cells that produce the melanin pigment. The study of Yoon and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] tried to determine the inhibition activity of the PA versus three melanogenic keys enzymes in murine B16 melanoma cells. These enzymes were tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2) and microphtalmina-associated transcription factor (MITF). The results showed an inhibition of tyrosinase, TRP-2 and MITF, and consequently PA is proposed as a potential anti-melanogenic agent and effective in hyperpigmentation disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Another effect of PA in skin and mucous is related to the human sebum. Human sebum consists mostly of triglycerides, wax esters and squalene, and its composition is characteristic of and unique to sebaceous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Sebum does account for the self-disinfecting activity at the skin surface, and PA accounts for most of this activity. Wille &#x00026; Kydonieus (2002) carried out an in vitro study based on collected skin surface lipids and investigated its antimicrobial activity. The results revealed that the PA at concentrations below 0.5&#x02009;mg/ml had little effect on the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and at concentrations above 1.0&#x02009;mg/ml were effective in preventing the attachment of pathogenic yeast cells to isolated sheets of mammalian stratum corneum. Due to its potential activity against the adhesion of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to the skin, PA is included as a medical preventive treatment for wound infections and catheter coatings. However, this fatty acid is not effective in gram-negative bacteria. The authors highlight the possibility that PA may be a natural antimicrobial gram-positive bacteria of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Yamamoto and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] investigate the bactericidal activity of PA calcium salt. By means of an in vitro study it was demonstrated the activity of this fatty acid against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>. The selective bactericidal ability of PA calcium salt is a suitable property for an ingredient of cosmetic products because, in some cases, a higher bactericidal action affecting all types of bacteria is not always the best option for human skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Cholesterol levels</title><p id="Par37">Moreover, PA seems to have an important role in lowering cholesterol levels. A study compares the effects of diet in regard to hypercholesterolemia in rats. The rats were distributed in six groups with different diets rich in either palmitate, stearate, palmitoleate, oleate, linoleate or &#x003b1;-linoleate. The palmitoleate was found to be as effective as linoleate in lowering the plasma cholesterol level. In addition, when it was compared to oleate and to other saturated acids, the palmitoleate was clearly more hypercholesterolemic. The mechanism of its activity remains unknown, but since there has been observed a high activity of lecitin cholesterol acil transferasa (LCAT) in rats fed with palmitoleate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the authors hypothesized that it may be associated to an increase of LCAT activity in plasma. In addition, a controlled trial with PA associated PA to a significant decrease in TAG and LDL-cholesterol, as well as to a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol in subjects with hyperlipidemia compared to the control group over 30&#x02009;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Insulin resistance and liver dysfunction</title><p id="Par38">Another effect of PA investigated in the study of Souza and colleagues (2016) is the possible relation between PA and hepatic insulin sensitivity. The design of the study consists in two groups of mice, one of them were fed a high-fat diet and the other a standard diet for 12&#x02009;weeks. In the last 2&#x02009;weeks, the high-fat diet mice were treated daily with oleic acid or palmitic acid. After 12&#x02009;weeks, the mice were injected with insulin or vehicle and various parameters were analyzed. The study concluded that PA supplementation in mice fed with high-fat diet stimulated the uptake of glucose and impaired the lipogenesis in liver by activation of AMPk and FGF-21, dependent on PPAR-&#x003b1;. All these effects are essential to control insulin resistance and to reduce the ectopic deposition of lipids in the liver. The study also suggested that PA plays an important role as a non-pharmacological treatment for diabetes and liver dysfunctions. Moreover, it highlighted an increased lipolysis and a decreased lipogenesis in adipocytes. Additionally, the immunity system was seen to be affected by PA, which decreased NF-kB p65 phosphorylation and proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that there is an increased insulin sensitivity in the liver and muscle, which improved hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia in diabetic rats when they were fed 300&#x02009;mg/kg of PA daily for 4&#x02009;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. More studies show a relation between the PA and the immunity system. This fatty acid promoted a suppressive effect in isolated human lymphocyte proliferation characterized by a decrease of Th1 and Th17 response, and co-stimulatory molecule (CD28) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Oleic acid (OA)</title><p id="Par39">OA (18:1) is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid with 18 carbons and a double bound situated in the carbon number 9. Seed and soft parts are rich in oleic acid. The proportions of OA in both parts are 13&#x02013;19% in seed oil and 12&#x02013;33% in pulp oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. An advantage of OA in regard to other monounsaturated fatty acids is its resistance to oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Although olive oil is the most well-known oil containing a high proportion of this fatty acid, there are other oils originating from plants such as sea buckthorn in which OA is also abundant. The Mediterranian diet is rich in OA due to the fact that one of the principal sources of fat is the olive oil, and there exist a strong association between a Mediterranean-style diet and protection for cardiovascular disease. Several studies show that OA decreases the expression of cell adhesion molecules in the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and this may be related to its antiatherogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Carluccio and colleagues (1998) research the effect of OA on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in an in vitro study. The results reveal that OA works as an inhibitor of endothelial activation reducing the atherosclerotic risk. A possible mechanism to explain these antiatherogenic properties is the effect of OA in the expression on monocyte adhesion accounted for by an inhibition of mRNA and, upstream, by inhibition of NF-kB activation after endothelial cell stimulation. In addition, other mechanisms related on the lipid profile or other cardiovascular risk factor may exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Polyunsaturated fatty acids</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>&#x003b1;-Linolenic acid (ala)</title><p id="Par41">ALA (18:3) is an unsaturated omega-3 fatty acid composed by 18 carbons and three <italic>cis</italic> double bonds. It must be acquired through diet because it is an essential fatty acid and it is an isomer of GLA.

EFSA authorized a health claim which affirms the contribution of ALA to the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is suggested that this effect is due to the ability of ALA to form precursors such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the human body. However, ALA may have an impact upon health independently to its precursor role. Its cardio protective effects may be due to various mechanisms, such as the reduction of plaque calcification and the number of lipids, the maintenance of endothelial function, the reduction of blood pressure and the exhibition of antithrombotic, anti arrhythmic and anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Several clinical trials have tried to demonstrate all these effects. Djouss&#x000e9; and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] carried out a cohort study where there was associated an inverse and dose-dependent relation between dietary ALA (range, 0.17 to 3.48&#x02009;g/d) and prevalent calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries (CAC). The presence of CAC is directly associated with the total burden of atherosclerotic plaques and its vulnerability. Consequently, the reduction of the presence of CAC decreases the risk of atherosclerosis, and viceversa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, a cross-over study with moderate hypercholesterolemic subjects was conducted to prove the influence of the diet in the inflammation process in cardiovascular disease. The three diets designed in this study were: American diet (control diet), a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and ALA (ALA diet) and a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and LA (LA diet). The subjects were assigned to a sequence of these 3 test diets: they consumed a diet for 6&#x02009;weeks and before starting the other diet they had a break period of 3&#x02009;weeks. The results showed that ALA diet decreased C-reactive protein, a protein involved in the atherosclerotic process. Also, ALA diet decreased vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin compared to control diet. The 2 high-PUFA diets decreased serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and TAG. In addition, ALA diet decreased HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI more than American diet and increased EPA levels in serum. The research concluded that a diet rich in ALA plays a role in reducing multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors such as decreasing pro inflammatory cytokines, changes in VCAM-1, lowering cholesterol levels or increasing EPA levels in serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The anti arrhythmic mechanism of LA is postulated to be related to modulation of sodium and calcium channels of the cardio myocytes. Another cardio protective effect mentioned is the ability of ALA to reduce blood pressure. A study published in the <italic>Journal of Olea Science</italic> evaluated the antihypertensive activity of ALA in subjects with high-normal blood pressure and mild hypertension. The subjects were divided in two groups: a group which consumed 14&#x02009;g of common blended oil and a group that intake ALA-enriched oil.

The actual treatments for the dry eye are not as efficient as they can be. For instance, artificial tears relieve symptoms without treating the causatives factors. Although anti-inflammatory drugs could produce side effects, they are still used to alleviate dry eye symptoms. In front of this situation, researchers are trying to investigate the potential effects of omega-3 fatty acids alone or with combination with omega-6 fatty acids in the treatment of dry eye. A randomized double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial recruited a total of 100 volunteers to prove the beneficial effect of omega-3 in the treatment of dry eye. Two groups were formed and during 3&#x02009;months (during the cold season) participants consumed 2&#x02009;g of sea-buckthorn oil or placebo.

Consequently, many studies have focused on the beneficial effects of LA in mucous membrane and skin (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The lamellar granules of human skin produce lipids that maintain the protective barrier of the skin in order to avoid the epidermal loss of water. Zielsinska and colleagues (2014) affirm that the reproduction of lamellar granules slows down with aging, the skin becoming drier and weaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

In addition, people with acne skin present a decrease of LA in sebum, which leads to block pores and formation of comedos and eczema.

The physical structure of the epidermal water barrier is defined as a lipid bilayer, which fills the intracellular spaces of the upper-most layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum). This lipid bilayer contains sphingolipids; in turn, those sphingolipids rich in linoleate are called acylglucosylceramide, acylceramide and acylacid. Although the feeding of LA in fatty acid deficient animals is known to reverse the major coetaneous symptoms, the mechanisms by which this happened remain unknown. A possible mechanism is the transformation of LA into 13-hydroxioctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). This reaction may be produced by incubated LA with soybean 15-lipoxygenase or 15-lipoxygenase prepared from skin epidermis in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The same study also demonstrated that 13-HODE formed was incorporated into epidermal phosphatidylinsotiol 4, 5-biphosphate, resulting in epidermal phospholipasa C-catalyzed release of 13-HODE into a novel 13-HODE-containing diacylglycerol. These results were obtained thanks to an in vivo trial in which Guinea pigs were randomized in three groups depending on diet: safflower (control), essential fatty acid deficiency diet, and essential fatty acid diet followed by safflower oil during 2&#x02009;weeks. The third group showed replenished tissue concentrations of 13-HODE after the introduction of safflower oil, which inversely correlated with the selective down-regulation of protein kinase C&#x003b2;. It is possible that this 13-HODE-containing-diacylglycerol could function to decrease the activity of epidermal protein kinase C and epidermal hyperproliferation and differentiation. These results suggest that the epidermal concentration of 13-HODE, which is derived from dietary LA, may play a role in modulating coetaneous hyperporliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Furthermore, LA seems to have an important role in the de novo biosynthesis of the major sebaceous fatty acids. An in vitro study of fatty acids from a biopsy punches from human facial skin rich in sebaceous glands was designed to try and elucidate the metabolisms of sebaceous lipids. Most fatty acids are esterified into triglycerides or polar lipids in sebaceous glands but LA is processed in a different way. It is hypothesized that LA is transformed into hydroxyperoxide by the lipoxygenase enzyme and this intermediate form is highly susceptible to &#x003b2;-oxidation. The results showed a correlation between the function and differentiation of sebaceous cells and the oxidation of LA. The study highlighted that the oxidation of LA is indispensable for the de novo biosynthesis of the major sebaceous fatty acids, such as palmitic and oleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Moreover, the positive effect of LA on psoriasis disease has also been considered.
