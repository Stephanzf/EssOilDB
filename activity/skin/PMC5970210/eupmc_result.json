    "Toxicities and color deformation were evaluated of essential oils of Melissa officinalis cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia and their constituents, along with the control efficacy of spray formulations (0.25, 0.5, and 1%) containing M. officinalis oils cultivated in France and its main compound against Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus adults. In a contact + fumigant bioassay, M. officinalis oil (France) was more active against D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus, compared to M. officinalis oils (Ireland and Serbia). Interestingly, color alteration of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus was exhibited, changing from colorless to golden brown through the treatment with M. officinalis oils. The acaricidal and color alteration principle of three M. officinalis oils was determined to be 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal. M. officinalis oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal were significantly more effective in closed containers than in open containers, indicating that their acaricidal route of action was largely a result of vapor action. Sprays (0.5 and 1%) containing 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and 1% spray containing M. officinalis oil (France) resulted in 100% mortality and color alteration against D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus. These results indicated that M. officinalis oil and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal could be developed as a suitable acaricidal and mite indicator ingredient for the control of dust mites."
