Introduction</title><p>Morels are some of the most highly prized edible and medicinal mushrooms, and outdoor cultivation has been achieved in recent years. These edible mushrooms appreciated worldwide have been used in traditional medicine for centuries, due to their health-related benefits. In recent research, the anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory bioactivities, immunostimulatory, anti-tumor and antimicrobial properties were reported [<xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It was considered that morel&#x02019;s health benefits were attributed mainly to sugar (polysaccharides) and to various constituents such as compounds, amino acids, important vitamin, fatty, organic acid and mineral profile [<xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The crude polysaccharide isolated from the fruiting bodies of <italic>Morchella importuna</italic> showed a neuroprotective effect against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PC12 cell cytotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress [<xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to unique flavor, taste and texture, morels are used in different recipes all over the world. Additionally, morels are used as a laxative, purgative, emollient, body tonic, and for stomach problems, healing wound and for general weakness [<xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Benefited from its high price, morels play a very important role in the economy of the country. Due to the high demand for morels and their increasing economic importance, research on its cultivation, bioactivity, functional compositions is being investigated more and more [<xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Anti-tumor bioactivity-guided isolation of the MeOH extraction of <italic>Morchella esculenta</italic> afforded eight compounds including three fatty acids and five sterols. Three compounds exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity to human lung cancer cell lines [<xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>Morchella</italic> protein hydrolyzate (MPH) produced by <italic>M. esculenta</italic> exhibits antioxidant activity [<xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The carboxymethylated polysaccharide (CPMEP) derived from the purified polysaccharide from <italic>Morchella angusticepes</italic> Peck (PMEP) showed stronger cholesterol-lowering activity than PMEP in rats [<xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Because of the limitation of wild <italic>Morchella</italic> resources, the cultivation of <italic>Morchella</italic> is increasingly popular for consumption as a functional food and for food-flavoring. Due to the limitation of strict techniques and difficulty in large-scale cultivation, fermentation has attracted more and more attention. It is of significance and potential to develop approaches to replace the traditional supply chain. However, there is no systematic research on the chemistry of liquid fermentation of <italic>Morchella</italic>. </p><p>Herein, a strain, YDJ-ZY-1, was isolated from wild <italic>Morchella</italic> in Zunyi Guizhou province and fermented in PDA media. Eight compounds were obtained from EtOAc extraction. Products 4 and 8 were new compounds and 7 was a new natural product.

There were also oxygen-bearing methylene carbon signals at &#x003b4; 61.1, as well as a methyl carbon at &#x003b4; 19.6.

The <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of 2 showed one carbonyl signal at &#x003b4;c 192.1.

Five concentrations were tested in the experiment, Vitamin C (VC) was the positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01706-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The data obtained in the present study suggests that compound <bold>5</bold> showed strong scavenging effect on DPPH free radical activity while compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> exhibited moderate activity against free radicals. Compounds <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold> almost exhibited no effect. For compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, the radical scavenging capacity increased as the increasing of compound concentration. Compared to <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> exhibited less activity while the difference was the one more substitute side chain at C3 in compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>. The antiradical activity may be affected by the side chain. Moreover, the length of the side chain has little effect on the activity. Statistical analysis indicated that clearance of different compounds at the same concentration is different. The clearance of the same compound is different at different concentrations. Compound <bold>5</bold> showed the best clearance at 0.25 mg/mL.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-24-01706"><title>3. Discussion</title><p><italic>Morchella</italic> are famous rare edible fungi with high medicinal and economic value that show great potential in food, health products, pharmaceutical and cosmetics. The effects of <italic>Morchella</italic> on immune regulation, preventing decrepitude, anti-tumor, anti-fatigue, protection of the cardiovascular system and liver are proven in pharmacological tests. With the development of modern techniques, new effective metabolites and active monomers are eager to be discovered. Polysaccharide of <italic>Morchella</italic>, the main active ingredient, was mostly investigated. Additionally, there are many other kinds of chemical constituents (amino acids, sterols, organic acids et al.) found from the fruiting body of the <italic>Morchella</italic> species. However, there are no reports on the chemistry of liquid fermentation. Strain <italic>Morchella</italic> sp.YDJ-ZY-1 was isolated from wild fruiting body in Zunyi Guizhou province, Southwest China. Chemical compositions of EtOAc extraction from liquid fermentation were investigated and eight secondary metabolites were obtained. Compound <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> were structures of pyrone, compound <bold>5</bold> was furan derivative, compound <bold>6</bold> was unsaturated fatty acid, and compounds <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold> were methyl cinnamate derivatives. Product 4 and 8 were new compounds while product 7 was a new natural product isolated from nature for the first time. Metabolite 5 with strong radical scavenging capacity was found the highest yield (3.4%). Product 6 linoleic acid, one of essential fatty acids that must be obtained through diet was proved important in metabolism and health. It could effectively reverse the inflammatory responses induced by palmitic acid treatment in microglial cells [<xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Research points to linoleic acid&#x02019;s anti-inflammatory, acne reductive, skin-lightening and moisture retentive properties when applied topically on the skin [<xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Product 7 and 8 with the structure of methyl cinnamate is mainly used in the daily chemical and food industry. Methyl cinnamate a flavor agent, is commonly used as fixative or edible flavor, but is also an important organic synthetic raw material. Methyl cinnamate is used as a chemical identification and distinguishing <italic>Tricholoma matsutake</italic> and <italic>Agaricus blazei</italic> and it could also provide a reference for evaluating the quality of edible fungi <italic>Tricholoma matsutake</italic> and <italic>Agaricus blazei</italic> [<xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01706" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because of it is rich in bioactive ingredients and has many pharmacological effects, <italic>Morchella</italic> has broad prospects for development and utilization. </p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-24-01706"><title>4.
