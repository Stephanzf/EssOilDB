    "The function of regulatory immune cells in peripheral tissues is crucial to the onset and severity of various diseases. Interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing regulatory B (IL-10+ Breg) cells are known to suppress various inflammatory diseases. However, evidence for the mechanism by which IL-10+ Breg cells are generated and maintained is still very limited. Here, we found that IL-10+ Breg cells suppress the activation of IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (IL-13+ ILC2s) in an IL-10-dependent manner in mice with oxazolone-induced severe contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Mast cell (MC) IL-5 was important for maintaining the population of IL-10+ Breg cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues. Overall, these results uncover a previously unknown mechanism of MCs as a type of immunoregulatory cell and elucidate the cross-talk among MCs, IL-10+ Breg cells, and IL-13+ ILC2s in CHS."
