Although epidermal growth factor (EGF) is essential for epithelial homeostasis and wound healing, the effect of EGF on AD remains to be explored. To develop a new therapy for AD, the anti-AD potential of EGF was investigated by inducing AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice using 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). EGF was administrated to NC/Nga mice to evaluate its therapeutic effect on DNCB-induced AD. EGF treatment improved dermatitis score, ear thickness, epidermal hyperplasia, serum total immunoglobulin E level, and transepidermal water loss in NC/Nga mice with DNCB-induced AD. In addition, levels of skin barrier-related proteins such as filaggrin, involucrin, loricrin, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were increased by EGF treatment. These beneficial effects of EGF on AD may be mediated by EGF regulation of Th1/Th2-mediated cytokines, mast cell hyperplasia, and protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which are triggers of AD. Taken together, our findings suggest that EGF may potentially protect against AD lesional skin via regulation of skin barrier function and immune response.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">AD is a multifactorial skin disease characterized by complex interactions of innate and adaptive immune responses in individuals with genetic, pharmacological, and psychological predisposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases and is characterized by impaired epidermal barrier, eczematous lesions, pruritus, dry skin, abnormal immune responses, and immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated allergies to various exogenous antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. When type 2&#x02009;T cells are activated, cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 are secreted to strengthen the humoral immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. IL-4 also plays a role in suppressing the function of type 1&#x02009;T cells. Allergic reaction caused by an imbalance between type 1 and type 2&#x02009;T cells is believed to cause AD. Other immune cells are also thought to be involved in AD. For instance, mast cells, which are major effector cells of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, are key factors in the pathogenesis of AD because they are allergen activated through the high-affinity IgE receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Mast cells are regulatory cells in Th2-dominant immune responses. Histamine is a major mediator released from mast cells that mediates pruritus by binding to the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor in the dermis. Activation of mast cells also causes the release of tryptase, which in turn activates PAR-2, localized on C fiber nerve terminals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Activated C fibers transmit this information to the central nervous system, where the sensation of itch is perceived.</p><p id="Par3">The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is crucial in skin development and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The EGF family comprises multiple mediators, including transforming growth factor-&#x003b1;, amphiregulin, heparin binding-EGF, and epiregulin, all of which regulate keratinocyte biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

In addition, EGFR ligands have been found to be upregulated in chronic inflammatory skin disorders, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. EGF facilitates epidermal cell regeneration and plays an essential role in the process of dermal wound healing by stimulating the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes. EGF treatment can stabilize mast cell degranulation, thereby reducing the release of granular products in gastric mucosal lesions of rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, production of IL-17A and expression of IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; in allergen-induced AD skin have been shown to be attenuated by EGF treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Topical application of DNCB produced AD-like lesions, including edematous erythema with scratching marks and dryness. Seven days after sensitization, the ear and dorsal skin of NC/Nga mice were re-sensitized with 0.4% DNCB and were treated with PRT 0.1%, EGF 1 ppm, or EGF 5 ppm for 2 weeks. PRT 0.1% is a well-known treatment for immune-mediated skin disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and was used as a therapeutic control. Treatment with EGF suppressed DNCB-induced AD-like skin inflammation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>). Treatment with EGF 1 ppm or EGF 5 ppm significantly reduced ear thickness on day 21 compared to the control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). In addition, EGF decreased dermatitis score of DNCB-induced skin lesions on days 14 and 21 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). AD-like lesions showed hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia of the epithelium. H&#x00026;E staining showed that the epidermal thickness of the ear and dorsal skin was attenuated by treatment with EGF and PRT 0.1% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B&#x02013;E</xref>). Thicker epidermis and dermis were observed in skin lesions of the control group. However, EGF 1 and 5 ppm significantly reduced the epidermal thickness of the ear and dorsal skin compared to the control group. Taken together, these findings suggest that topical administration of EGF protects against DNCB-induced AD in NC/Nga mice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>EGF efficiently prevents the development of mouse atopic dermatitis.

TEWL increased and moisture retention decreased during the 21-day experimental period. TEWL of AD-like skin lesion was significantly lower in the EGF 1 and 5 ppm groups on day 21 than the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). In addition, the corneometer score was significantly higher in EGF 1 and 5 ppm group on day 21 than in the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Skin barrier proteins, including tight junction (TJ) components, are involved in epidermal barrier function and prevent TEWL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Skin barrier dysfunction could be due to defective epidermal proteins. To determine the effect of EGF on epidermal proteins in AD-like lesions, we performed immunoblotting experiments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Protein extracts were prepared from the dorsal skin of NC/Nga mice with DNCB-induced AD-like lesions. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, expression levels of epidermal proteins such as filaggrin, involucrin, loricrin, occludin, and ZO-1 were higher in the EGF- and PRT 0.1%- treated groups than in the control group.

EGF administration increased the protein level of filaggrin, involucrin, loricrin, and occludin in DNCB-induced AD-like skin lesion. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that EGF administration modulates skin barrier recovery by upregulating the production of epidermal proteins.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>EGF enhances skin barrier repair in DNCB-induced AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice.

To reduce the allergic response in autoimmune diseases such as AD, it is necessary to control activated mast cells. To assess the inhibitory effect of EGF on mast cell hyperplasia <italic>in vivo</italic>, toluidine blue staining of the dorsal skin of DNCB-treated mice was performed to observe mast cell feature. The number of mast cells decreased significantly after administration of EGF compared to that in the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). In addition, spleen weight was measured to determine immune system status (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).

However, spontaneous AD-like lesions in this model are late onset and have a low incidence (&#x0003c;50%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we used 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), a commonly used allergenic chemical, to induce AD in this study. When mouse skin is repeatedly exposed to DNCB, it exhibits hyperkeratosis, a thick epidermis, and infiltration of lymphocytes and mast cells, similar to human AD symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We found that topical application of EGF attenuated DNCB-induced AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. EGF treatment improved skin lesion severity, hyperkeratosis, ear and epidermal thickness, dermatitis score, and scratching behaviors of DNCB-treated NC/Nga mice. Moreover, DNCB-induced mast cell infiltration and serum IgE levels were reduced following EGF application. We also observed that EGF restored epidermal water loss by upregulating the expression of skin barrier-related proteins. In addition, we found that EGF treatment balanced the Th1/Th2 immune response and reduced levels of PAR-2 and TSLP in DNCB-treated NC/Nga mice. These findings suggest that topical administration of EGF may be useful for the treatment of AD.</p><p id="Par11">AD is characterized by skin barrier defects as well as increased immune responses. Previous reports showed that TEWL of lesional skin was significantly increased in patients who had a disturbed skin barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Many consequences of a dysfunctional skin barrier can be explained by defective epidermal proteins. In both lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with AD, filaggrin mutation has been shown to contribute to increased TEWL, a measure of skin barrier integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Filaggrin is a key protein that supports terminal differentiation and skin barrier formation. Filaggrin-deficient mice have increased antigen penetration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and filaggrin-deficient patients have markedly increased surface pH of skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, changes in stratum corneum lipids in nonlesional skin have been found to be associated with reduced barrier function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. &#x0201c;Flaky tail&#x0201d; mice deficient in profilaggrin exhibit reduced occludin, E-cadherin, and loricrin expression, as well as decreased EGFR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and humans with FLG mutations show decreased expression of the TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In the present study, EGF treatment resulted in recovery of levels of the epidermal proteins filaggrin, involucrin, loricrin, occludin, and ZO-1 to control levels. Moreover, EGF treatment significantly decreased TEWL and increased corneometer score compared to the controls. Interestingly, a previous study demonstrated that EGF restored barrier defects induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced barrier disruption of TJs in Caco-2 cells, but EGF prevented disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and dissociation of occludin and ZO-1 through interaction with occludin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Furthermore, EGF differentially regulated the association of PP2A, which dephosphorylates occludin, with PKC&#x003b6;, which phosphorylates occludin, required for the assembly of tight junctions in Caco-2 cells. EGF attenuated the increased binding of PP2A with occludin and decreased binding of PKC&#x003b6; with occludin in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced differentiated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. These protective effects of the skin barrier suggest that EGF treatment can inhibit allergen-induced derangement of keratinocyte functions.</p><p id="Par12">Impaired skin barrier function increases the intake of allergens and causes inflammation. Inflammation can in turn reduce skin barrier function. For example, a decrease in filaggrin expression was observed after treatment of epidermal models with TNF-&#x003b1; and Th2 cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In addition, keratinocytes that differentiate in the presence of IL-4 and IL-13 are known to reduce filaggrin level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Cytokines are other triggers of AD, and AD inflammation is associated with increased levels of serum IgE and inflammatory infiltrates such as lymphocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages that produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31. While the Th2 cytokine IL-4 is important in acute atopic eczema, the Th1 and Th17 cytokines IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-17, and IL-22 predominate in chronic eczema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Under normal condition, Th1 and Th2 responses are balanced by cytokine regulation. IL-4 inhibits the generation of Th1-cells, whereas IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits IgE synthesis and Th2 expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In acute AD, Th2 lymphocytes produce many cytokines that can increase IgE production including IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. IgE, in turn, activates mast cells and basophils. Activation of mast cell induces the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; from the granules of mast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. A recent study showed that EGF treatment had protective role against AD by suppressing allergen-induced IL-6 production by keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, upregulation of EGFR and its ligand expression have been found in chronic inflammatory skin disorders including AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We demonstrated that EGF can inhibit mast cell infiltration and its allergic effects. Moreover, EGF decreased levels of IgE and proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-13 in serum and dorsal AD-like lesions. In contrast, EGF treatment significantly increased serum and dorsal levels of IFN-&#x003b3;. These effects may be related to the reduction in spleen weight caused by EGF treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of EGF treatment for attenuating immune responses by regulating T-lymphocyte balance and mast cell infiltration.</p><p id="Par13">PAR-2 is an important biological regulator of inflammation, the immune response, and the release of cytokines and growth factors in the skin. Some of these effects might be mediated, at least in part, by activation of PAR-2, a molecule that regulates skin homeostasis and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown a correlation between TSLP expression and PAR-2 activity in the skin of AD mouse models and in patients with atopic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In addition, PAR-2 activation can lead to robust expression of TSLP in keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In particular, Th2 cytokines are known to be triggered by TSLP produced by keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. TSLP is one of several candidates that can trigger Th2 commitment by activating DCs to induce differentiation of naive T cells to Th2 cells. In addition, mast cell tryptase might be a crucial mediator of itch by activating PAR-2 in sensory nerves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. TSLP released from keratinocytes acts directly on sensory neurons to trigger robust itch-evoked scratching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To better understand the mechanism of allergic inflammation and prutitus, we determined the expression levels of PAR-2 and TSLP were determined in this study using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Expression of PAR-2 and TSLP proteins was significantly decreased by EGF treatment. Furthermore, ERK phosphorylation was attenuated by EGF treatment in AD-like skin lesions. It is known that the production of TSLP and IL-25 by protease is mediated by p38 and ERK pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, TSLP induction by UVB was inhibited upon treatment with ERK inhibitors in keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Although the EGFR signaling pathway is important in skin development and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, some studies on this signaling pathway have produced mixed results in AD. In one study, EGFR activation by EGF was found to protect against AD by decreasing IL-17A and IL-6 expression in an AD model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Another study showed that transactivation of EGFR by TNF-&#x003b1; results in TSLP induction in keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. However, amphiregulin, one of the EGFR ligands, suppressed dermatitis via EGFR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and epiregulin deficiency lead to chronic skin inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Our data showed that EGF treatment has a remarkable downregulatory effect on TSLP expression in the skin. These data support that EGF can act as an immunoregulator by decreasing TSLP levels in AD-like skin tissues. Interestingly, the prolonged use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors is associated with a common side effect of skin inflammatory rash in cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In addition, blockage of the EGFR enhances skin inflammation by inducing chemokine expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Similar to these studies, we found that the expression of Th2 cytokines and TSLP reduced after EGF treatment. In this regard, although EGF (5ppm) did not show a better effect than EGF (1ppm) treatment on PAR-2 and TSLP expression, our findings indicate that EGF can ameliorate itching as well as the immune response by inhibiting PAR-2 and TSLP expression in AD lesions.</p><p id="Par14">Results of this study demonstrate that EGF has anti-AD potential. Topical administration of EGF has been successfully used to treat a variety of peripheral tissues wounds. Therapeutic efficacy and excellent tolerance of EGF have been proven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Administration of EGF resulted in improved Th1/Th2 balance and inhibited mast cell hyperplasia, a major process in the induction of atopic dermatitis. It also ameliorated DNCB-induced AD-like skin inflammation in mice. Our results suggest that EGF can improve AD symptoms, although further research is necessary to clarify the effect of EGF on the sensory neurons of AD-like skin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par15">Seven-week-old male NC/Nga mice were purchased from Central Laboratory Animal Inc.
