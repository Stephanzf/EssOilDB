    "The Atopic march denotes the progression from atopic dermatitis (AD) to the development of other allergic disorders such as immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated food allergy, allergic rhinitis and asthma in later childhood. There is increasing evidence from prospective birth cohort studies that early-onset AD is a risk factor for other allergic diseases or is found in strong association with them. Animal studies now provide mechanistic insights into the pathways that may be responsible for triggering the progression from the skin barrier dysfunction seen in AD to epicutaneous sensitization, food allergy and allergic airway disorders. Recent large randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of early interventions targeted at AD and food allergy prevention. These show great promise for research into future strategies aimed at prevention of the atopic march."
