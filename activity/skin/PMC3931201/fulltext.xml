Maintaining healthy skin is important for a healthy body. Many people may develop skin diseases that affect the skin, including cancer, herpes and cellulitis. Some wild plants and their parts are frequently used to treat these diseases. The use of plants is as old as the mankind. Natural treatment is cheap and claimed to be safe. It is also suitable raw material for production of new synthetic agents. A review of some plants for the treatment of skin diseases is provided that summarizes the recent technical advancements that have taken place in this area during the past 17 years.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ethnomedicine</kwd><kwd>herbs</kwd><kwd>medicinal plants</kwd><kwd>skin diseases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human skin, the outer covering of the body, is the largest organ in the body. It also constitutes the first line of defense. Skin contains many specialized cells and structures. It is divided into three main layers viz. epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. Each layer provides a distinct role in the overall function of the skin. Epidermis, the outer most layer of the skin, varies in thickness in different regions of the body. It is the thinnest on the eyelids (0.05 mm) and the thickest on the palms and soles (1.5 mm). The dermis also varies in thickness depending on the location of the skin. It is 0.3 mm on the eyelid and 3.0 mm on the back of the body. The dermis is attached to an underlying hypodermis or subcutaneous connective tissue. The subcutaneous tissue is a layer of fat and connective tissue that houses larger blood vessels and nerves. This layer is important in the regulation of temperature of the skin itself and the body. The size of this layer varies throughout the body and from person-to-person. Hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands are the main skin appendages.</p><p>The skin guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. There are two general types of skin, hairy and glabrous skin.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, the skin can be dry, sensitive, pale, sagging or tired. People deficient in essential nutrients such as beta-carotene, the B complex vitamins and vitamins C and E often suffer from the drying of the skin.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>FUNCTIONS OF SKIN</title><p>Because it interfaces with the environment, skin plays a key role in protecting (the body) against pathogens.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and excessive water loss.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, storage and synthesis of vitamin D by action of ultraviolet (UV) and the protection of vitamin B folates, absorption of oxygen and drugs[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and water resistance.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Severely damaged skin will try to heal by forming scar tissue. This is often discolored and depigmented.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>COMMON SKIN PROBLEMS</title><p>Skin disease is a common ailment and it affects all ages from the neonate to the elderly and cause harm in number of ways.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There are more than a thousand conditions that may affect the skin but most skin diseases can be categorized into nine common types.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Rashes</title><p>A rash is an area of red, inflamed skin or a group of individual spots. These can be caused by irritation, allergy, infection, an underlying disease, as well as by structural defects for example, blocked pores or malfunctioning oil glands. Examples of rashes include acne, dermatitis, eczema, hives, pityriasis rosea and psorasis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Viral infections</title><p>These occur when a virus penetrates the stratum corneum and infects the inner layers of the skin. Examples of viral skin infections include herpes simplex, shingles (herpes zoster) and warts. Some systemic viral infections, such as chicken pox and measles, may also affect the skin. Viral infections cannot be cured with antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Bacterial infections</title><p>Such infections are caused by a variety of bacteria, the most common types being staphylococci and streptococci. Bacteria may infect the topmost layers of skin, the follicles, or the deeper layers of skin. If not treated correctly, these infections may spread throughout the body. Examples include impel folliculitis, cellulitis and lyme disease. Bacterial infections are better treated with antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Fungal infections</title><p>Harmless fungi are always present on surface of the skin. Infection occurs when these organisms enter into the body. These infections are usually superficial, affecting the skin, hair, nails and include athlete's foot, lock itch and ringworm. However, in people with suppressed immune system or who have been taking antibiotics for long period -, the fungi may spread to deep within the body, causing more serious disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Parasitic infections</title><p>These infections occur after exposure to parasites such as lice and scabies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Pigmentation disorders</title><p>The amount of pigment in the skin is determined by the amount of melanin being produced by the body. Loss of pigment (hypo pigmentation) can be caused by absence of melanocytes, malfunctioning cells, exposure to cold or chemicals, or some types of infection. An increase in pigment (hyperpigmentation) may be caused by skin irritation, hormonal changes, aging, a metabolic disorder, or any other underlying problem. Age spots, freckles and melasma are examples of hyper pigmentation. Vitiligo is an example of hypo pigmentation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Tumors and cancers</title><p>These growths arise when skin cells begin to multiply faster than normal. Not every skin growth is cancerous. Some tumors are harmless and will not spread. Skin cancer is the most common of all the cancers, affecting 800,000 Americans each year. It is caused, in 90% of cases, by sun exposure. The three types of skin cancers are basal cell cancer (the most curable), squamous cell cancer (which may grow and spread) and malignant melanoma (the most deadly form). Prevention involves protecting the skin against damaging ultraviolet rays. Early detection helps to improve the chances of a cure. Regular self-examinations are, therefore, recommended.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Trauma</title><p>Trauma describes an injury to the skin caused by a blow, a cut, or a burn. Whenever the surface of the skin is broken, the body becomes more susceptible to infection and disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Other conditions</title><p>Wrinkles, rosacea, spider veins and varicose veins are among those conditions that cannot be neatly categorized. Wrinkles are caused by a breakdown of the collagen and elastin within the dermis, which results in sagging skin. Rosacea is a chronic disorder in which the skin of the face becomes red and develops pimples, lesions and more rarely enlargement of the nose. Its cause is unknown. Spider veins and varicose veins become apparent when blood vessels enlarge and become visible through the surface of the skin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF SKIN DISEASES</title><p>The common medications for topical use include[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Antibacterials: These medicines, like bactroban or cleocin, are often used to treat or prevent infection</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anthralin (drithocreme, micanol and others): Although not often used, these help to reduce inflammation and can help treat psoriasis</p></list-item><list-item><p>Antifungal agents: Lamisil, lotrimin and nizoral are few examples of common topical antifungal drugs used to treat skin conditions such as ringworm and athlete's foot</p></list-item><list-item><p>Benzoyl peroxide: Creams and other products containing benzoyl peroxide are used to treat acne</p></list-item><list-item><p>Coal tar: This topical treatment is available with and without a prescription, in strengths ranging from 0.5% to 5%. Coal tar is used to treat conditions including seborrheic dermatitis (usually in shampoos) or psoriasis.

</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>HERBAL DRUGS FOR SKIN DISEASES</title><p>Natural drugs from the plants are gaining popularity because of several advantages such as often having fewer side-effects, better patient tolerance, being relatively less expensive and acceptable due to a long history of use. Besides herbal medicines provide rational means for the treatment of many diseases that are obstinate and incurable in other systems of medicine. For these reasons several plants have been investigated for treatment of skin diseases ranging from itching to skin cancer. So far 31 plants have been reported to be effective in various skin diseases during the past 17 years (1995-2012) of research work, which are mentioned below.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title><italic>Achyranthes aspera</italic> (Common name: Prickly chaff flower, Devil's horsewhip; Family: Amaranthaceae)</title><p>Traditionally, the plant is used in boils, scabies and eruptions of skin and other skin diseases. The MeOH extract, alkaloid, non-alkaloid and saponin fractions obtained from the leaves of <italic>A. aspera</italic> exhibited significant inhibitory effects (concentration 100 &#x003bc;g) on the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by the tumor promotor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells. In this <italic>in vitro</italic> assay the non-alkaloid fraction containing mainly non-polar compounds showed the most significant inhibitory activity (96.9%; 60% viability). In the <italic>in vivo</italic> two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis test the total methanolic extract possessed a pronounced ant carcinogenic effect (76%). The results revealed that leaf extract and the non-alkaloid fraction are valuable antitumor promotors in carcinogenesis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title><italic>Allium cepa</italic> (Common name: Onion; Family: Liliacea)</title><p>A study undertaken in patients with seborrheic keratoses to evaluate the ability of onion extract gel to improve the appearance of scars following excision, has shown that this extract gel improved scar softness, redness, texture and global appearance at the excision site at study weeks 4, 6 and 10 as assessed by the blinded investigator.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In another study, the antifungal activity of aqueous extracts prepared from <italic>A. cepa</italic> (onion; AOE) and <italic>Allium sativum</italic> (garlic; AGE) were evaluated against <italic>Malassezia furfur</italic> (25 strains), <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (18 strains), other <italic>Candida</italic> sp.

Garlic ingestion delayed formation of skin papillomas in animals and simultaneously decreased the size and number of papillomas, which was also reflected in the skin histology of the treated mice. The protective effect against skin cancer elicited by garlic in mice is believed to be due at least in part to the induction of cellular defense systems.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title><italic>Aloe vera</italic> (Common name: Barbados aloe; Family: Xanthorrhoeaceae)</title><p><italic>Aloe vera</italic> has shown very good results in skin diseases and it is often taken as health drink.

It also seems to be able to speed wound healing by improving blood circulation through the area and preventing cell death around a wound. One of the studies conducted on mice to investigate the effects of <italic>Scutellariae radix</italic> and <italic>Aloe vera</italic> gel (AV), in spontaneous atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin lesions revealed that the group receiving only AV in a dose of 0.8 mg/kg p.o provided relief in AD due to reduction of interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-10 levels.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The gel has properties that are harmful to certain types of bacteria and fungi.

The test group received aqueous <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> leaf extract (AAILE) orally at a dose level of 300 mg/kg body weight three times a week for 20 weeks. The results of this study revealed the chemopreventive potential of <italic>A. indica</italic> against murine skin carcinogenesis.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Study designed to determine the modulatory effect of aqueous AAILE on cell cycle-associated proteins during two-stage skin carcinogenesis in mice in which skin tumors were induced by topical application of DMBA as a carcinogen followed by the repetitive application of TPA as a promoter. Skin tumors obtained in the DMBA/TPA group exhibited enhanced expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, index of proliferation), p21 and cyclin D1, with no alterations in p53 expression in comparison to the control group. Tumors in AAILE + DMBA/TPA group exhibited low PCNA and cyclin D1 expression and enhanced expression of p53 and p21 in comparison to the DMBA/TPA group. The skin tumors obtained in the AAILE + DMBA/TPA group exhibited high lipid peroxidation levels in comparison to the tumors obtained in the DMBA/TPA group. The observations of the study suggested that AAILE behaves as a pro-oxidant in the tumors, thereby rendering them susceptible to damage, which eventually culminates into its anti-neoplastic action. Also, cell cycle regulatory proteins may be modulated by AAILE and could affect the progression of cells through the cell cycle.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Another study, conducted on an anti-acne moisturizer formulated from herbal crude extracts and investigated for the physico-chemical parameters as well as antibacterial activity of the formulation, revealed that ethanol extract of <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic>, <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>, <italic>A. indica</italic> and Green tea possessed the potential for inhibiting acne.

More than 80% of people in India depend on traditional health care and use different plant based products for curing skin related problems. Compared with the conventional allopathic drugs, they have relatively low cost and can be of great benefit to the population of India in general and poor people in particular. Herbals are a rich source of active ingredients and can be safer and cost effective treatment for skin diseases ranging from rashes to dreadful skin cancer. More than 50% of plant species useful for treatment of skin diseases appear to be restricted to forests, so activities such as deforestation, habitat destruction, urbanization etc., may pose a serious threat to these species. Conservation of these plants with the help of local participation and carrying out of extensive research in this respect to broaden the prospects of herbal drugs in skin disease treatment is the need of the hour.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lookingbill and Marks&#x02019; Principles of Dermatology</article-title><year>2006</year><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-name>Elsevier Inc</publisher-name><comment>ISBN no. 1416031855</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Proksch</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Brandner</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The skin: An indispensable barrier</article-title><source>Exp Dermatol</source><year>2008</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>1063</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19043850</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Madison</surname><given-names>KC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Barrier function of the skin: &#x0201c;la raison d&#x02019;&#x000ea;tre&#x0201d; of the epidermis</article-title><source>J Invest Dermatol</source><year>2003</year><volume>121</volume><fpage>231</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12880413</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grice</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><name><surname>Conlan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Deming</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Topographical and temporal diversity of the human skin microbiome</article-title><source>Science</source><year>2009</year><volume>324</volume><fpage>1190</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19478181</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pappas</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Your Body Is a Wonderland of Bacteria.
