This means that millions of people are living with the diagnosis of cancer. However, chemotherapy and combination therapy with other medical and radiation therapies are associated with an array of adverse cutaneous reactions; this is true whether therapy is classic mono- or polychemotherapy, hormonal agents, or newer targeted therapies. These cutaneous toxicities are not only frequent but also highly visible on the face, arms, and/or upper torso. Thus, patients and treating physicians increasingly need to manage the acute cutaneous reactions associated with chemotherapy.<xref rid="b1-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Skin toxicities associated with classic cytotoxic drugs and hormonal therapy include dry skin, as well as hair and nail alterations. Antimetabolites such as capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil can cause hand&#x02013;foot syndrome which is characterized by erythema, swelling, blisters, ulceration, and desquamation on the palms and soles, associated with paresthesia, pain, and pruritus.<xref rid="b3-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Alkylating agents are associated with alopecia, hyperpigmentation, and recall radiation dermatitis.<xref rid="b4-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Anti-spindle or anti-mitotic agents including vinca alkaloids and taxanes cause nail changes, maculopapular rash, erythema, and alopecia.<xref rid="b4-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition, DNA modifiers such as bleomycin and topoisomerase inhibitors can cause erythema, paronychia, alopecia, hyperpigmentation, and sclerosis.<xref rid="b4-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Inhibiting EGFR by using monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors commonly causes acneiform eruption, papulopustular rash, and xerosis. Acneiform eruption is experienced by 67%&#x02013;86% of patients using EGFR inhibitors.<xref rid="b5-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Other common toxicities include paronychia (inflammation of the lateral nail wall), abnormal hair growth (including scalp, face, eye lashes), maculopapular rash, fissures, telangiectasia, mucositis, hand&#x02013;foot syndrome, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.<xref rid="b3-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These side effects are unsurprising as EGFRs are expressed in the skin (keratinocytes, follicular epithelium, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands), and EGFR signaling is involved in the homeostasis of hair follicles.<xref rid="b9-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with rash, pruritus, and vitiligo.<xref rid="b10-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Frequently, dysfunction of both interfollicular keratinocytes and epidermal stem cell proliferation and differentiation is observed.

Forty-seven female patients also received a silicium colorless nail polish. Tolerance of products was evaluated by patients for the whole body according to 4 categories (excellent, good, medium, and bad) including the irradiated area for patients with concomitant radiotherapy. At the end of the study, the investigating physician rated their opinion regarding the skin benefit of the product kit (very good, quite good, good, or neither good nor bad).</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluations</title><p>Throughout the course of the chemotherapy, and particularly at the initial visit and at the last visit (9&#x000b1;3 weeks later), related skin reactions (including edema, erythema, dryness, desquamation, pigmentation disorders, and cracks with a 4 grade-scale: absent, low [grade 1], moderate [grade 2], and severe [grade 3]) and cutaneous clinical signs (pruritus, skin pain, sensitivity, tingling, and burning sensations with a 10 cm-VAS, 0 for absence to 10 for maximal sensation) were assessed by the oncologists. Cutaneous comfort and tolerance of the products supplied were also evaluated. National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)-defined skin toxicities were recorded.

The study protocol and corresponding appendices were also transmitted to a French Research Ethics Committee (CPP, Poitiers, France) for information purposes in December 2012. The CPP confirmed the nonnecessity to get an approval for this study. However, each investigating center was responsible for submitting the protocol to its hospital ethics committee and obtaining the corresponding approval, whenever applicable.

The 147 patients who completed the study were recruited from 5 centers: Paris, France (31% of patients); Milan, Italy (28%); Berlin, Germany (23%); Madrid, Spain (12%); and Montreal, Canada (6%). Mean age (&#x000b1;SD) was 59&#x000b1;11 years (range: 28&#x02013;84) and 71% of patients were female. Sixty-one percent had fair skin (skin types I&#x02013;III), and 39% had dark skin (skin types IV&#x02013;VI). Thirty-nine percent were treated for female cancer (ie, ovary or breast), 31% for digestive system cancer (ie, colon or rectum), 20% for a head and neck cancer, and 10% for other cancer types (including leukemia or pancreatic carcinoma). Sixteen percent were initiating chemotherapy alone (3% neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 31% adjuvant chemotherapy), 35% concomitant radiochemotherapy, and 15% sequential radiochemotherapy. Twenty-seven percent started a mono-chemotherapy and 73% a polychemotherapy. Types of chemotherapy included alkylating agents (80% of patients), antimetabolites (44%), anti-spindle agents (30%), DNA modifier (21%), and other molecules (12%). The mean number of planned chemotherapy cycles was 5.3&#x000b1;3.3 (range: 1&#x02013;16) and mean cycle duration was 19.2&#x000b1;8.0 days (range: 5&#x02013;51). Out of the female population, 14% had hormonal agents included in their treatment but only 2 women were taking those already at inclusion.</p><p>For patients receiving concomitant radio- and chemotherapy (n=51), the average area treated by radiotherapy was 12.2&#x000b1;7.7 palms (range: 2.5&#x02013;36) and the total average dose of Gray received during treatment was 59&#x000b1;12 Gy (range: 10&#x02013;70).</p><p>Throughout the study, 16% of patients had therapeutic regimen changes or dose adaptations.</p></sec><sec><title>Product use</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ott-11-5865">Figure 1</xref> shows the frequency of each product use during the study. The 5 most frequently used products were the cleansing oil, the hand cream, the body balm, the shampoo, and the repairing foot cream. Seventy-three percent of patients used 8 products or more during the study and 44% used 7 products or more, often, or every day. Three categories users were defined by the number and the frequency of products used (never, sometimes, often, and every day) as follows: casual users (0&#x02013;6 products used often or every day), regular users (7 or more products used often or every day), and not evaluable (because of missing data). Seventy-nine patients were classified as casual users (54%), 63 as regular users (43%), and 5 patients (3%) were not evaluable. <xref rid="t1-ott-11-5865" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents patient demographics for casual and regular users.</p><p>Product tolerance on the whole body was rated good to excellent by more than 89% of the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-11-5865">Figure 2</xref>). For the 37 patients with concomitant radiotherapy, the tolerance of the 5 products used on the irradiated zone was rated good to excellent by more than 94% of the patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Skin reactions, clinical signs, and skin toxicities</title><p>At baseline, 40 patients (27%) declared at least 1 skin reaction (16 patients had 1 symptom, 13 patients had 2 symptoms, 8 patients 3 symptoms, and 3 patients 4 symptoms). The most common skin reaction was dryness (26% of patients), followed by erythema (11%), edema (8%), desquamation (8%), pigmentation disorders (4%), and cracks (2%). Skin reactions were most commonly grade 1 (low), with lower incidence of grade 2 (moderate) reactions.</p><p>The patients were followed for 9 weeks on average. Aggravation of skin reactions (increased grade) during the study, the primary criterion, was reported by 44 patients (31%). Interestingly, aggravation was reported by a significantly lower percentage of regular users (22%) versus casual users (39.5%) (<italic>p</italic>=0.0295) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-11-5865">Figure 3</xref>). A similar trend for lower rates of aggravation in regular users was observed for erythema (<italic>p</italic>=0.0159) and desquamation (<italic>p</italic>=0.0275) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-11-5865">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>A multivariate analysis including confounding variables (variables showing differences between casual and regular users at baseline; country, gender, radiotherapy, presence of clinical sign(s) at baseline, chemotherapy by spindle poison or by antimetabolite) indicates that concomitant radiotherapy is highly linked to this aggravation. Seventy-eight percent of patients with concomitant radiotherapy showed an aggravation versus 7% of patients without. Of patients who underwent concomitant radiotherapy, aggravation was more frequent for casual (82%) versus regular users (69%) (<italic>p</italic>=0.47).</p><p>Clinical skin symptoms (pruritus, skin pain, sensitivity, and tingling and burning sensations) were increased compared to the baseline. However, the global scores for clinical symptoms were comparable between casual and regular users at baseline (2.6&#x000b1;4.6 and 3.05&#x000b1;4.8, respectively) and at the final visit (4.4&#x000b1;7.5 and 4.5&#x000b1;7.8, respectively).</p><p>During the study, 31 patients (21%) had a NCI CTCAE-defined skin toxicity: 15 patients (48.4%) had radiodermatitis, 10 (32.3%) had erythema, 2 (6.5%) had acneiform rash, and edema, pruritus or rash was reported for 1 patient each. The frequency of skin reactions was comparable between casual and regular users (<italic>p</italic>=0.30). At onset, skin toxicity was grade 1 (low) for 52% of patients and grade 2 (moderate) for 48%. Mean onset to skin reaction from chemotherapy initiation was 23.4&#x000b1;11.6 days (22.9&#x000b1;12.9 days for casual users, 25.6&#x000b1;7.3 days for regular users) with no significant difference.</p></sec><sec><title>Physician and patient opinion</title><p>At the end of the study, the investigating physicians rated their opinion regarding the skin benefit of the 12-product kit as being good. There was a higher percentage of good opinion reports for regular than casual users (100% versus 92%; <italic>p</italic>=0.0094).</p><p>The patient-assessed global morale score was numerically, although nonsignificantly (<italic>p</italic>=0.08) higher for regular than casual users at baseline (61&#x000b1;16 and 62&#x000b1;18, respectively) and at the final visit (59&#x000b1;16 and 63&#x000b1;16, respectively). PBI &#x0003e;1 indicating relevant benefit of the kit was reported for 100% of regular users versus 92% of casual users. Global PBI score was significantly higher for regular (3.23&#x000b1;0.7) than casual users (2.8&#x000b1;1.1; <italic>p</italic>=0.0495).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the benefit of using a nonpharmaceutical skin care kit containing body and face cleansers, body, face, hand and foot moisturizers, a shampoo, a thermal spring water spray, a wound healing product, and a body and face sunscreen for preventing skin side effects induced during chemotherapy alone or with radiotherapy. This differs from previous research which studied 1 product or skin washing only.<xref rid="b17-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The most frequently used products in this case were the cleansing oil, the hand cream, the body balm, the shampoo, and the repairing foot cream, which appear the essential products in most cases. In this study, the subjects using the kit were patients with various malignancies who received chemotherapy alone or concomitant or sequential radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Study results provide additional support for the use of appropriate skin care protocol in the management of cutaneous reactions due to chemotherapy associated or not with radiotherapy. We found that 31% of patients had aggravated clinical signs, erythema, dryness, desquamation, edema, pigmentation disorders, and cracks during the study, but if patients received a concomitant radiotherapy the percentage reporting aggravation increased to 78% (versus 7% without concomitant radiotherapy). However, in a similar study, performed with breast cancer patients, 85% of patients had at least 1 skin toxicity appearing within 5 days from treatment initiation.<xref rid="b21-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>These data indicate that radiotherapy induced more clinical skin signs (in 77.6% of treated patients) than chemotherapy alone or in sequential treatment with chemotherapy (in only 6.7% of treated patients). This is also supported by the fact that during this study, radiation dermatitis was a frequent skin toxicity. Therefore the use of appropriate skin care products to minimize the impact of secondary cutaneous reactions is more important in the case of radiotherapy (alone or associated with chemotherapy).</p><p>Nevertheless, as previously demonstrated for breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy only, regular users of well-tolerated skin care products presented with skin toxicities later than low users. Interestingly, significantly fewer regular users had aggravated skin symptoms (22%) compared with casual users (40%).</p><p>This indicates that following a skin care routine with appropriate products could reduce the aggravation of skin reactions and could also treat some of them (disappearance of skin signs in 9% of patients). This further supports the current thinking that therapy-related cutaneous adverse events are linked to skin barrier dysfunction.<xref rid="b17-ott-11-5865" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, these results were associated with a better overall opinion of investigating physicians and a higher relevant benefit for the patients.
