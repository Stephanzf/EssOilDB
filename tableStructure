#### TABLE

**profile** 

#### Description 
Profile for each reported experiment. Profiles can be recorded in an article as single column or a multicolumn table, 
in which case each column is a separate table, linked by bibliographic reference and independent variables. A profile 
relates to a single `plant`. All independent experimental variables should be in or linked to this table.

#### Note
Used to be `infoPdata`.

(The *results* of the experiment are in **profiledata**). 

#### Columns

- profile_id - Primary key. Auto-incremented.
- plant_id [FK] - Foreign key to `plant`. 
- location_id (FK) - Foreign key to `location`.
- biblio_id (FK) - Foreign key to `bibliography`.
- date_id - in ISO8601 date format
- plantPart_id (FK) - Foreign key to plantpart. 
- condition - VARCHAR - "condition" data.  
- method_id (FK) - Foreign key to `method`. 
- legacy_profile_id (JEA*..) for backwards compatibility to V1.0
- profile_id (FK) chemical data for each profile.
- wikidata (URL)
- taxize (ID)

#### Recommendation
Include Date column and remove Date table.
Transfer "condition" to a field.

## **plant**
