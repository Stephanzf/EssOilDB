The densities of the essential oils were determined manually through calculation of the essential oil's mass and volume as well as by densitometer (the mean pure density of the essential oil was determined 850 &#x003bc;g/ml). Different purities of a number of antibiotics (vancomycin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin [Sigma, USA]) were also assessed both in combination with the essential oils and separately as controls and the synergistic effects were investigated by determination of the MBC and MIC.

Briefly, the antibacterial effects of these two essential oils were more potent on <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and the antibacterial effect of <italic>C. copticum</italic> essential oil was more potent than that of <italic>M. piperita</italic> on the same bacteria.</p><p>In this study, the synergistic effects of <italic>C. copticum</italic> and <italic>M. piperita</italic> essential oils with antibiotics on a number of bacteria were investigated.

In the current experimental study, the synergistic effects of <italic>C. copticum</italic> essential oil and <italic>M. piperita</italic> essential oil with ciprofloxacin on <italic>E. coli</italic> were found to have FIC of 0.6 and 3, respectively, which is in disagreement with Fadlie <italic>et al</italic>.'s study. This inconsistency in the findings can be due to difference in the percentages the chemical compounds among the essential oils.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In addition, Fadlie <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the synergistic effect of <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> essential oil with ciprofloxacin on <italic>S. aureus</italic> had an FIC of 0.26, but in the current study, <italic>M. piperita</italic> essential oil was found to have no synergistic effect with ciprofloxacin. A study investigated the synergistic effect of <italic>Chrysanthemum indicum</italic> with ampicillin and gentamicin on the growth of some species of bacteria using broth microdilution and concluded that <italic>C. copticum</italic> essential oil combined with ampicillin could decrease MIC of <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and S. epidermidis by 1:2&#x02013;1:6 but did not display synergistic effect (FIC of 0.5&#x02013;1).[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In this study, <italic>C. copticum</italic> essential oil exerted synergistic effect with gentamicin on <italic>S. aureus</italic> such that the MIC decreased from 3.2 to 2.0 &#x003bc;g/ml and FIC was 0.25 that represented their synergistic effect. In the current study, <italic>C. copticum</italic> essential oil exerted synergistic effect with vancomycin on <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which can be due to <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptibility to the compounds in the plant-based essential oils that needs further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p><italic>C. copticum</italic> can exert a potent antibacterial effect that can cause a significant synergistic effect if accompanied by the antibiotics. In this study, it was demonstrated that <italic>C. copticum</italic> essential oil exerted synergistic effect with vancomycin. It is expected that these plant-based essential oils alongside antibiotics be incorporated into health-care system through further studies so that their useful effects can be used to fight drug resistance or to lower dosage or toxicity of the drugs.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts
