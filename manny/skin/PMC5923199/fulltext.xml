IL-31 was reported to be increased in specimens from patients with atopic dermatitis, and IL-31-transgenic mice develop atopic dermatitis-like skin inflammation, which is involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. However, the role of IL-31 in development of contact dermatitis/contact hypersensitivity (CHS), which is mediated by hapten-specific T cells, including Th2 cells, is not fully understood. Therefore, we investigated this using IL-31-deficient (<italic>Il31</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice, which we newly generated. We demonstrated that the mice showed normal migration and maturation of skin dendritic cells and induction of hapten-specific T cells in the sensitization phase of FITC-induced CHS, and normal induction of local inflammation in the elicitation phase of FITC- and DNFB-induced CHS. On the other hand, those mice showed reduced scratching frequency and duration during FITC- and/or DNFB-induced CHS. Our findings suggest that IL-31 is responsible for pruritus, but not induction of local skin inflammation, during CHS induced by FITC and DNFB.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">IL-31, which is a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, is produced mainly by activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in particular activated Th2 cells, mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.Human and mouse IL-31 genes are located on chromosome 12q24.31 and chromosome 5, respectively, and their amino acid sequences show 31% homology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Several studies using type-2-cytokine-deficient mice showed that type-2 cytokines are important for the development of CHS (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>), suggesting that IL-31 may be involved in induction of CHS. <italic>Il31ra</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed enhanced type-2 immune responses due to hyperresponsiveness to OSM by increased formation of OSM receptors (the complex of gp130 and OSMR) rather than due to failure to form IL-31 receptors (the complex of IL-31RA and OSMR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we deemed that murine strain to be unsuitable for examining the role of IL-31 in CHS, and we instead used IL-31-deficient (<italic>Il31</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice, which we newly generated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of <italic>Il31</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p id="Par5"><italic>Il31ra</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were reported to have not only loss of IL-31 function but also elevated responsiveness to OSM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, suggesting that it is necessary to elucidate the exact roles of IL-31 <italic>in vivo</italic> by using <italic>Il31</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice rather than <italic>Il31ra</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.
