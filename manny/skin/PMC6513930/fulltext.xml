Meibomian glands are responsible for secreting the lipid component of the tear film to prevent its evaporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Decreased or altered secretion of the meibomian glands are therefore the main causes of dry eye syndrome, with consequent instability of the tear film, inflamed and thickened palpebral margins, presence of palpebral crusts, foamy tear film, damage to the ocular surface epithelium and chronic blepharitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea or<italic> Demodex</italic> infestation (a common parasite of the microbial flora of the skin) can all be involved in the malfunctioning of the meibomian glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As posterior blepharitis induces chronic inflammation that can cause permanent damage to the meibomian glands, treatment is recommended even in asymptomatic or mild cases. The Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend the following treatments for blepharitis: warm compress, eyelid hygiene, antibiotics (doxycycline or other tetracycline topical and/or systemic) and topical anti-inflammatory agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Daily cleansing of eyelids and cilia with warm compresses is essential for symptomatic relief of blepharitis, and routine application removes debris, softens thickened secretions, removes ciliary dandruff and cleans the eyelid margin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If an infestation of<italic> Demodex</italic> mites is suspected, daily lid cleaning with 50% tea tree oil and massaging of the eyelid with 5% tea tree oil ointment is an additional topical treatment option to resolve posterior blepharitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The most active component of tea tree oil is terpinen-4-ol, which is the primary agent responsible for the<italic> Demodex</italic> killing effect of this oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

During the 2-week run-in period (Visit 1&#x02013;Visit 2) and after the patients had provided informed consent, investigators collected demographic data and medical history and performed a physical examination of each patient; in addition, the patients were instructed on how to properly apply the treatment according to the description in the <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Treatment</xref> section. Patients were given a diary to record any daily symptoms as well as any adverse events (AEs) associated with the therapy (i.e. itching, redness, soreness); they were also asked to grade the symptoms according to their severity (mild, moderate or severe) to enable evaluation of the change in symptoms during the follow-up visits.

To address these issues, several devices for eyelid warming have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; however, the often high costs and limited practicality of these tools have limited their wide-spread use in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The rationale for the development of the Blephapad Combo compress was to have a heat source that is quick and easy to prepare and which also allows the patient to easily identify the temperature of the compress. The compress changes color when it reaches a temperature greater than 43&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, allowing patients to adequately heat the eyelid area prior to using the wet wipe. In addition, the substance in the compress releases heat slowly compared with a pad composed of only water. When the heated Blephapad Combo compress is applied onto the eyelid, it opens the occluded meibomian glands and allows the production of lipids necessary for a healthy tear film; following the use of the compress, the Blephapad Combo wipes are applied. These wipes contain terpinen-4-ol, the most potent ingredient present in tea tree oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as well as hyaluronic acid and aloe, all of which have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities and have been shown to reduce the presence of<italic> Demodex</italic> mites in the eyelid margin and improve the signs and symptoms of chronic blepharitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Despite the fact that some of the recently developed therapies for blepharitis mainly focus on reducing<italic> Demodex</italic> infestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], to our knowledge none to date have used a warm compress followed by eyelid hygiene measures. The results of the present study show that the combination of both these treatments appears to improve clinical symptoms of blepharitis. Moreover, in our study compliance with this treatment was high (96%). One explanation for the high compliance rate in our study could be the relatively short duration of treatment (4&#x000a0;weeks). However, since compliance was high in both the Blephapad Combo and control arms, the most likely explanation is the well-known phenomenon of enhanced compliance by patients participating in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">There are a number of limitations to this analysis, most of which are associated with patient availability at the clinic where the study was conducted. To address this issue, changes between the experimental and standard treatment were plotted sequentially, a statistical technique that does not require a fixed sample size. The sequential analysis offers important advantages over the usual statistical procedures with a fixed sample size: (1) the data are analyzed as they are collected, reducing the amount of data needed to reach statistically valid conclusions and allowing for the possibility of stopping the clinical trial early during interim analyses; (2) the greater the difference between treatments, the fewer patients are needed to achieve statistical significance. As seen with this analysis, using a sequential analysis design allowed us to show that Blephapad Combo was superior to standard treatment with a relatively small sample size.</p><p id="Par31">Treatment with Blephapad Combo was shown to be more effective compared with the standard treatment and to be safe in patients with blepharitis. Further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to confirm our initial results; however, we were able to demonstrate a statistically significant result using a small cohort of patients because the closed sequential analysis enabled us to considerably reduce the number of cases relative to studies with a fixed sample size. The simplicity of use with Blephapad Combo was associated with high compliance to treatment, a fundamental requirement for treatments of blepharitis, which is characterized by frequent periods of symptom exacerbations and requires long-term therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced Digital Features</bold></p><p>To view enhanced digital features for this article go to 10.6084/m9.figshare.7862648.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par32">This research was not financially supported by any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
