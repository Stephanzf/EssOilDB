Being one of the most visible appendages, its disfigurement has a significant impact on the self-esteem and self-image of the sufferer. Hence, it becomes imperative to treat nail afflictions because the patients specifically request for it. However, at the same time, the unique anatomy of the nail ensures that there are difficult to penetrate, sanctuary sites within the nail unit. For example, the proximal nail fold formed by a double layer of skin, thrown back upon itself [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] protects, and largely masks the underlying nail matrix. Similarly a thick, relatively impervious nail plate overlies the nail bed epithelium. As a result, the germinative portions of the nail unit (largely the nail matrix; and to a much lesser extent, the nail bed) are both shielded very effectively against environmental insults. Paradoxically, this very protection comes in the way of effective drug delivery for treating dermatoses affecting the nail unit. Thus, for an effective topical therapy across the nailplate, ungual drug permeation needs to be enhanced.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sagittal section of the nail unit. The germinative portions (mainly the nail matrix and to some extent the nail bed) are effectively shielded from topical drug penetration</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-373-g001"/></fig><p>There is a significant risk of treatment failure when it comes to treating nail disorders. We know that upto 20&#x02013;30% cases of onychomycosis fail to respond to treatment with systemic, topical or combination drug therapy with the very same drugs which are otherwise effective against the fungi invitro.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This is mostly due to a poor bioavailability at the affected sites within the nail unit. Other conventional modes of therapy, including phototherapy, do not work that well in the nail unit either. Additionally, prolonged duration of treatment and antecedent risks involved with systemic therapy means that it may not be justifiable for patients with predominant or isolated nail involvement. To ensure optimal bioavailability of effective medications, this compromised conventional drug delivery in nail diseases needs to be circumvented. The present review aims to offer practical solutions to this end.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Intralesional Therapy in Nail Disorders</title><p>Over the years, various methods have been used to enhance drug delivery within the nail unit. These are summarised in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Among these, intralesional administration of drugs is a form of &#x02018;targeted therapy&#x02019;offering specific advantages in this complex appendage. As explained above, the germinative portion of the nail unit needs to be targeted for treating inflammatory nail dystrophies and the best way to reach it is injectable administration of drugs. This bypasses the need for systemic administration (thus minimising potential systemic side effects) or topical administration (which is anyways highly compromised). It aids deposition of a drug depot ensuring prolonged action at the site where it matters the most. The rationale for intralesional therapies in nail disorders is summarised in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Various methods used to enhance drug delivery within the nail unit</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-373-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Rationale for intralesional therapy in nail disorders</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-373-g003"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Preparation for the procedure</title><p>As the administration of nail injections is expected to be moderately painful under the best of circumstances, as well as excessively painful for some; the patient is to be prepped accordingly. Most of the patients would agree to try out the injections and continue to take them at prescribed intervals without requesting for anaesthesia (author's personal experience). For those requesting pain relief there are various techniques and tricks available to minimise procedure-related pain. These are summarised in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Tips and tricks to minimise pain during nail injections</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-373-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Contraindications to injectable therapies</title><p>There are no absolute contraindications to this form of therapy. However, one should be careful about any visible focus of infection at the site or in the vicinity (even though injectables are often used for infectious conditions like warts and chronic paronychia). Signs or symptoms of peripheral ischaemia or peripheral vascular compromise should always be ruled out. The use of sterile needles is imperative to prevent the spread of blood-borne infections including the dreaded HIV.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Expectation alignment</title><p>A key aspect while starting intralesional drug therapy in nail unit is to provide realistic expectations to the patient. They should be made to understand the need for prolonged duration of therapy and monthly follow-ups. It should be impressed upon them that practically no improvement may be visible for the initial 2&#x02013;3 months (or even longer in toe nails). The need for maintenance therapy in most of the inflammatory nail dystrophies should also be explained; as well as the possibility of suboptimal or no response needs to be reinforced.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Drugs found useful for injection in the nail unit</title><p>Over the years, various drugs which have been tried for injecting in the nail unit are summarised below:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Triamcinolone acetonide (TA):[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Intralesional TA in the proximal nail fold has been used as a treatment modality in patients with trachyonychia/twenty-nail dystrophy, nail lichen planus or nail psoriasis. It is used in strengths varying from 2.5&#x02013;10mg/ml. Predominant side effects include proximal nail fold hypopigmentation and atrophy. TA injected into the proximal nail fold area is a useful, cheap and efficacious treatment for dermatoses affecting the nail unit</p></list-item><list-item><p>Methotrexate:[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It has been used in cases with nail psoriasis, not responding to other commonly used treatment modalities. Side effects include pain and slight injection site discolouration. There is also a need to keep track of the cumulative dose to assess systemic effects. Nail bed injections of methotrexate are a safe and effective therapy for isolated nail psoriasis with both the nail bed and the matrix changes responding well</p></list-item><list-item><p>Terbinafine:[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Intralesional administration of controlled-release microspheres incorporating terbinafine has been tried as an alternative mode of treating onychomycosis. This is a single study evaluating such a formulation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Bleomycin:[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Intralesional bleomycin has been used as an effective treatment for periungual warts. Bleomycin hydrolase responsible for inactivating the drug is found in very small amounts in skin. Thus a significant amount of the active drug becomes available at the site of action when injected intralesionally. It can be injected by multiple-puncture technique using a bifurcated vaccination needle; however, intralesional administration as detailed below has been found to have a very high success rate.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Potential side effects include extravasation into normal skin, extensive necrosis, scarring, pigmentary changes, nail damage and Raynaud's phenomenon[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine:[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This offers a safe and effective immunotherapy tried in cutaneous warts by eliciting a strong immune response against human papillomavirus (HPV). The same can be used for ungual warts as well. The technique is simple and cost-effective with good efficacy and tolerability, less side effects and lower relapse rate</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cyclosporine:[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Intramatricial cyclosporine has rarely been used in nail psoriasis in the dosage of 50 mg/ml. In a recent study conducted by Mittal and Mahajan, it was reported that difference in efficacy of intramatricial TA, methotrexate and cyclosporine in nail psoriasis, was not statistically significant. However, methotrexate yielded the best results with the maximum number of nails showing complete recovery.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] On the other hand, nails treated with intramatricial cyclosporine demonstrated the maximum number of side effects, including severe pain which can decrease patient compliance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Vitamin D3:[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] This is a form of immunotherapy for warts. Vitamin D3 (0.2 ml, 15 mg/ml) is injected at the base of the wart after giving local anaesthesia. The injections are repeated at 2 weekly intervals till wart clearance. The authors had demonstrated good amount of clearance in cutaneous warts as well as a few periungual warts.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Techniques for Intralesional Therapy</title><p>Depending on the targeted area of drug administration, intralesional therapy in nail diseases can be of various types. The nail being a complex appendage, different parts of the nail unit impact the growth of nail plate differently. This can be easily deciphered by a trained observer. For example, changes in the nail plate (like pitting or onychorrhexis) are a result of inflammation affecting the nail matrix which thus needs to be treated. Similarly, nail bed changes like onycholysis, subungual debris or salmon patch necessitate the site of administration to be the nail bed. The predominant clinical feature along with the type of injection required are summarised in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>How nail features guide the mode of injectable therapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-373-g005"/></table-wrap><p>Once the appropriate site for treatment is chosen, it further determines the mode of administration and type of injection to be given.

For consenting patients, a complete pre-procedure evaluation and photographic documentation is done prior to starting injections.</p><p>The injections are preferably given with the patient in a lying down position. We generally ask the patient to lie prone and extend the hand/foot to be injected towards the operator. These injections are administered with a 1ml syringe. We prefer the use of insulin syringes as they have a longer needle designed for &#x02018;subcutaneous administration&#x02019; of insulin as compared to the tuberculin syringe which is designed for &#x02018;intradermal administration&#x02019;. Most commonly a 30&#x02013;31 G needle with 6&#x02013;8mm length is chosen. The needle should be built-in the syringe to enable injection under pressure, preventing any needle dislodgement or backsplash.</p><p>The local area is cleaned with spirit and povidone iodine. The point of injection is 2mm below and lateral to the junction between the lateral and proximal nail folds. We inject with the needle entering almost parallel to the skin surface; inserting it further till there is a feeling of loss of resistance. The needle is advanced upto the middle of PNF [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. An aspiration is attempted to ensure that no blood vessel has been entered accidentally. Thereafter, the drug is slowly infused to raise a semilunar blanch arising from the lunula. This blanch is the endpoint of injection and no more than 0.1&#x02013;0.2 ml of the drug can usually be administered in an average sized nail (personal observation) [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>].

To prevent needle dislodgement or backsplash, it is imperative that a Luer-locked syringe or insulin syringe with a built-in needle is used. The backsplash is particularly likely during bleomycin injections in warts due to the fissured surface of warts (personal observation). Thus, it is advised to use eye protection during this procedure. The amount of drug to be infiltrated is dependent on the size of the lesion being injected. For bleomycin injection in warts, the endpoint is blanching/yellowish appearance of the wart. For larger warts, multiple injections may be needed to adequately infiltrate all the sectors.

Translesional administration hence remains the procedure of choice.</p><p>There are isolated reports of a controlled-release drug delivery system which can be injected in the nail unit. It involves the use of injectable, biodegradable polymer [poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres] which can be injected intralesionally.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] These drug-impregnated polymers then ensure a controlled and sustained release of terbinafine for prolonged periods which is required for treating onychomycosis. This has been projected as a potential alternative mode of treatment.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Results</p><p>Some of the results produced with translesional drug administration of bleomycin [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">b</xref>] and triamcinolone [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13a</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">c</xref>] are shown.</p><fig id="F12" position="float"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p>Response to translesional bleomycin injections in ungual warts.

Some patients prefer these due to less pain caused as compared to injectable therapy,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; However, use in clinical practice is not very common.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The probable reasons include varying efficacy of different devices and the risk of side effects like backsplash and spread of infections, formation of epidermal inclusion cysts and so on.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of intralesional therapies in nail unit have been evaluated sparsely over the years. <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> summarises the studies available in this regard with different drugs being used for various nail unit diseases.</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Efficacy of intralesional therapy in various nail disorders</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-373-g018"/></table-wrap></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Side Effects of Intralesional Therapy</title><p>The main disadvantage of intralesional injection in nail unit is the pain experienced at the site of injection. This is also the major reason for lower patient compliance and relatively poor acceptability in general dermatologic practice. Other than this, sideeffects are minimal. At times, subungual haematoma formation can occur, the incidence of which can be minimised by ensuring appropriate haemostasis after withdrawing the needle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Figure 14</xref>]. Proximal nail fold hypopigmentation and/or atrophyhave been seen with injections of TA [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">15a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">b</xref>]. Matrix injections may occasionally produce deleterious effects causing disturbed nail growth. However, all these complications are largely preventable and fortunately reversible. The risk of hypersensitivity reactions has to be kept in mind and prior history needs to be carefully sought. Apprehensive patients may experience vasovagal syncope occasionally; hence the injections should be administered in a proper setup, with adequate positioning of the patient as well as readiness to handle dermato-surgical emergencies. Nicolau syndrome following intramatricial triamcinolone has been reported as a rare complication.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</p><fig id="F14" position="float"><label>Figure 14</label><caption><p>Subungual haematoma seen post-nail bed injections</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-373-g019"/></fig><fig id="F15" position="float"><label>Figure 15</label><caption><p>(a) Hypopigmentation and atrophy involving the proximal nail fold seen secondary to intramatricial injections.

Drugs like TA, methotrexate or bleomycin can be effectively administered to the affected part of the nail unit. Careful precautions and preparation with thorough attention to the injection technique is very useful in optimising treatment outcomes and minimising side effects associated with the procedure. Though they are commonly used, there is very less data available in literature as of now, regarding their efficacy. Future controlled studies comparing injection techniques or treatment protocols can help standardise these treatment options.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title/><sec id="sec3-8"><title>Financial support and
