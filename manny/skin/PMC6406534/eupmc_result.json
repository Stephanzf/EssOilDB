    "To evaluate the fluctuation of secondary metabolites in Arabian lilac during a year, aerial parts of the plant were harvested in the middle of each month. The essential oils content from fresh and dried plant materials was analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), individually. Phytochemical contents, along with antiradical scavenging potential of the related methanol extracts were separately assessed. The spring and autumn samples (fresh and dried) yielded more essential oil than the other samples. Forty-one compounds were identified totally in the oils and the major constituents characterized were β-caryophyllene, sabinene, and caryophyllene oxide. The extracts obtained from winter and summer plants possessed the highest total phenolics. The maximum amount of total flavonoid content was measured in winter (December and January), whereas the minimum one was observed in spring (March). The summer and winter samples showed the highest and lowest content of flavones and flavanols, respectively, whereas the anthocyanin content was higher in winter than in summer. Moreover, antiradical activity of the extracts in summer and winter samples was higher than in other seasons. Overall, this study can provide useful information regarding the best harvest period of Arabian lilac to yield the desired compounds for application in phytopharmaceutical and food industries."
