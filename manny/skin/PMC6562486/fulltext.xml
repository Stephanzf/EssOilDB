Introduction</title><p>Bee venom (BV) is a secretion from the stinger of the worker bee; it is a complex mixture of proteins they use to protect themselves. Purified BV from honeybees has been used as a traditional medicine by the ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Greeks [<xref rid="B1-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. BV contains pharmaceutically active peptides including melittin, apamin, adolapin, and the mast cell degranulating (MCD) peptide; enzymes (e.g., phospholipase A2, PLA2); biologically active amines (e.g., histamine and epinephrine); and nonpeptide components [<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Melittin, the major component (50% of dry weight) of BV, has anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritis properties, which are driven by the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) [<xref rid="B3-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Melittin has shown anticancer, antibacterial, and antiviral activities [<xref rid="B4-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PLA2 from BV improved atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin lesions induced by dust mite extract in mice. Topical application of PLA2 suppressed AD symptoms, including ear thickness, histological changes, inflammatory cytokines, and serum IgE concentration [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effects of BV are expected to improve skin inflammatory diseases such as AD, but this has not been clearly demonstrated.</p><p>AD is the most common allergic skin disease, but its pathogenesis is complex and still not fully understood. Researchers have shown that the complex immune reactions associated with the Th2 response and IgE production affect AD, but Th22, Th17, and Th1 activation also occur in AD [<xref rid="B6-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, the complement system seems to affect AD. One study reported that complement components including C3, C4, and C3a are increased in AD patients compared to non-atopic controls [<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Overactivation of the complement system has been shown to cause damage to the dermal-epidermal junction [<xref rid="B9-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which may aggravate AD. In addition, the anaphylatoxin C5a receptor is increased in AD mice, and treatment with a C5aR antagonist decreased IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; levels in skin tissue, as well as the levels of IL-4, IFN-&#x003b3;, histamine, and IgE in the serum, indicating that blocking C5aR can inhibit AD [<xref rid="B10-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the role of complement inhibitory proteins (CIPs) in AD has not been elucidated.</p><p>In the current study, we investigated the role of BV in the regulation of the complement system. We examined the upregulation of CD55 in THP-1 cells and the levels and activities of C3 convertase (C3C) and membrane attack complex (MAC) from the serum of AD-like mice after treatment with BV or melittin. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-11-00239"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxins-11-00239"><title>2.1. BV Increased CD55 Production in THP-1 Cells</title><p>Because complement cascades are regulated by membrane-bound complement regulators including membrane cofactor protein (MCP/CD46), decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), and CD59 [<xref rid="B11-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we investigated whether THP-1 cells express cell membrane CIP in response to BV. CD46 mRNA was reduced by approximately 50% in the cells after stimulation with BV, while the mRNA levels of CD59 were reduced by a low level of BV (e.g., 0.001&#x02013;0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL) and slightly upregulated by 1 &#x003bc;g/mL BV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the samples. These results suggested that BV-induced variations in CD46 and CD59 may not affect the activation of the complement system and AD symptoms. CD55, unlike other CIPs, showed a bell-shaped curve when cells were stimulated with BV. The highest induction of CD55 was caused by 0.01 &#x003bc;g /mL BV, and higher dosages of BV such as 0.1 and 1 &#x003bc;g/mL reduced CD55 expression compared with untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). When cells were treated with BV doses of up to 10 &#x003bc;g/mL, cell death was not observed, indicating that the induction and inhibition of CD55 by BV in cells were not associated with cell survivability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Actually, the viability of THP-1 cells was significantly increased by BV (0.01&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g/mL), suggesting that BV may affect cell proliferation. When cells were treated with 0.01 &#x003bc;g/mL BV, CD55 mRNA peaked at 6 h and then declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). The protein levels of CD55 also increased from 3 h after stimulation and peaked at 6 h; they then declined after 12 h but were still higher than in unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). Our data suggest that BV regulates CD55 expression in immune cells, which may affect complement cascades in the bloodstream. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-11-00239"><title>2.2. BV Induced CD55 Through the Activation of ERK</title><p>Next, we investigated the signaling pathway related to the BV-mediated induction of CD55 in THP-1 cells. After treatment with BV, activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) was observed, while other signaling molecules, including P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), protein kinase B (Akt), and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2), were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The densitometry analysis also indicates that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was activated by BV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). We examined the phosphorylation of NF-&#x003ba;B subunit p65, but it was not activated by BV treatment (data not shown). When cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for each signal, only the ERK inhibitor reduced CD55 expression in BV-treated cells, indicating that BV increases CD55 expression through the activation of ERKs in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-11-00239"><title>2.3. BV Alleviated AD Symptoms</title><p>Since BV has been used as traditional medicine [<xref rid="B1-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], we examined whether BV has a treatment effects of AD. An AD-like condition was induced in mice (irritant contact dermatitis (ICD)) by treatment with 2.5% 2,4-Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) for 14 days. The experimental group was subcutaneously injected with BV and treated with 0.2% DNCB, while the control group was treated only with 0.2% DNCB. Clinical assessment of the ICD mice was performed as described in the Materials and Methods section. The skin condition such as dryness, hemorrhage, excoriation, edema and redness, increased significantly in the DNCB-treated mice (ICD) at 14 days, but it was attenuated in the group that was injected with BV (ICD+BV) at 18 days and the skin almost completely recovered at 27 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The clinical skin score in the BV-injected group also significantly decreased at 12 days as compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxins-11-00239"><title>2.4. BV Inactivated Complement System in AD-Like Mice </title><p>We examined whether BV affects complement in an AD-like mouse model, developed by treatment with 2.5% DNCB. First, we measured the levels of C3C and MAC in serum using sandwich ELISA kits. The serum levels of C3C and MAC in normal mice significantly decreased after BV treatment. In mice that developed ICD, both levels were significantly higher compared with the untreated mice (&#x02018;none&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D). When comparing the ICD mice groups, both C3C and MAC significantly decreased after BV injection compared with PBS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). On the other hand, the secreted CD55 serum levels decreased in ICD mice, but significantly increased after BV injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). These data suggest that BV inhibits the complement system. The actual activity of complement was examined in mouse serum. The bactericidal activity decreased with BV in untreated mice, while it increased in ICD mice compared to the untreated mice. The bactericidal activity in ICD mice decreased in the BV-injected ICD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f004">Figure 4</xref>D), indicating that MAC activity was increased in AD, which is consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and it was decreased by BV injection. Since an abnormal increase of MAC damages skin tissues, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate level of MAC. Thus, BV may be a good candidate to maintain MAC homeostasis. Next, we examined the role of CD55 in complement-mediated tissue damage, using a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f004">Figure 4</xref>E). Normal human serum (NHS, 1:20 dilution) significantly decreased HaCaT cell viability, indicating that complement induced the cell death of keratinocytes. However, when NHS was added to the BV-treated cells, the viability increased in a BV dose-dependent manner. Increased viability, however, was not shown when cells were treated with anti-CD55 neutralization antibody prior to BV treatment, indicating that increased CD55 inhibits MAC activity, which may affect the alleviation of AD symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-toxins-11-00239"><title>2.5. Melittin Alleviated AD Symptoms Through the Regulation of Complement</title><p>When ICD mice were subcutaneously injected with melittin (0.15 mg/kg), AD symptoms were alleviated as seen in BV-injected mice. Melittin is a major component of BV and contributes anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects [<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Skin condition was improved in melittin-injected ICD mice as well as in BV-injected ICD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). To examine whether melittin affects complement, C3C levels were examined in serum from ICD mice that were injected with melittin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f005">Figure 5</xref>B, serum C3C levels were significantly lower compared with untreated ICD mice. The same reduction was shown in BV-injected mice. MAC levels in ICD mouse serum were also significantly decreased in melittin-injected mice compared to the ICD control mice, although they were slightly higher than in the BV-injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). The secreted CD55 levels in melittin-injected ICD mice were significantly higher than in the control ICD mice, suggesting that the complement system was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). These data suggest that BV, especially melittin, can alleviate AD via controlling complement.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-toxins-11-00239"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Purified BV has anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects [<xref rid="B12-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It also reduces AD symptoms, lowering serum IgE levels and dorsal skin thickness [<xref rid="B13-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. AD is a chronic skin inflammatory disease characterized by eczematous, dry, and chapped skin. AD is caused by the invasion of inflammatory immune cells including mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophages, and T lymphocytes into the skin barrier. The circulating eosinophils and serum IgE levels are increased in AD, which is associated with interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 produced by the Th2 cells in most patients [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, complement appears to aggravate AD. Patients with AD show increases in complement components including C3, C4, and C3a [<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Because activation of complement generates a high level of MAC, MAC can worsen AD lesions, aggravating AD symptoms. </p><p>The complement system is an essential part of the immune system. It has long been described as belonging to the innate immune system, but recently a number of papers have demonstrated that it also contributes to adaptive immunity by regulating antigen-presenting cells [<xref rid="B19-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As an inducer for innate immunity, MAC, a final product of complement cascades, kills invading bacteria, and anaphylatoxins, such as C3a and C5a, activate inflammatory responses. However, excessive activation of the complement system can induce tissue damage and inflammation, which aggravates symptoms in patients with AD [<xref rid="B20-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, it is necessary to reduce excessive activation of the complement system and restore homeostasis to defend against bacterial infection. Toxins isolated from insects and snakes seem to have beneficial effects against inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="B22-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but they are also toxic and potentially life-threatening for mammals [<xref rid="B23-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. </p><p>BV has beneficial effects on idiopathic Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold allodynia, and it is helpful in reducing glutamate-induced cell toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="B24-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. BV components, especially melittin, inhibit complement cleavage and release bradykinin. These mechanisms are associated with coagulation, thrombolysis, hemolysis, and smooth muscle tone [<xref rid="B28-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recently, Shaldoum et al. have reported that BV may affect complement system. According to the results, in patients having various diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, back pain, diabetes mallets, arthritis, gastritis, sebaceous cyst, osteoarthritis, and hepatitis c virus, all abnormal levels of complement C3 returned to normal values, while abnormal C4 levels did not change when patients were exposure to natural BV [<xref rid="B29-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study we have established the following mechanisms of BV in the alleviation of AD; (i) BV induced CD55 production through the activation of ERK1/2 pathways; (ii) increased CD55 downregulated formation of C3C and MAC; (iii) decreased MAC activity resulted in the alleviation of AD symptoms. BV may be a promising drug to treat AD, because it inhibits complement by inducing CD55. Among CIPs, only CD55 dramatically increased in BV-treated THP-1 cells and in serum from BV-injected mice. Although the mechanism for CD55-dependent inactivation of C3C is complex [<xref rid="B30-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the expected result is a reduction in MAC formation. The dose-dependent variation of CD55 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f001">Figure 1</xref>B suggests that BV has different activities in mammalian cells. BV causes the activation of the immune system, which could increase the symptoms of atherosclerosis, diabetes-related endothelial damage, cancer, and autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="B31-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, it also has anti-inflammatory properties and is used in the treatment of liver fibrosis, atherosclerosis and other skin diseases [<xref rid="B32-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>We found that CD55 did not completely inhibit C3C in BV-injected mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00239-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the increased C3C in BV-injected mice was restored to a normal state. The MAC level and activity also recovered to a normal state. These data suggest that BV does not inhibit the complement system completely, but can still protect against invasion of bacteria and support the repair of damaged tissues. However, the appropriate dosage should be considered when applied to mammals. The complement inhibitory effects of BV and melittin suggest that they can be used to treat complement-mediated diseases such as ischemia/reperfusion injury and autoimmune disorders, which are caused by excessive complement activation [<xref rid="B21-toxins-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p><p>In conclusion, BV, especially melittin, appears to alleviate AD. This phenomenon appears to be mediated by ERK pathway activation leading to the induction of CD55 in BV-treated cells. CD55-mediated inhibition of complement alleviates AD symptoms, which can otherwise be aggravated by inflammation and MAC. Thus, BV can be considered as a therapeutic reagent to treat AD as well as inflammatory diseases. </p></sec><sec id="sec4-toxins-11-00239"><title>4.
