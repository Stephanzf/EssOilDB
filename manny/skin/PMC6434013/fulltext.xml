In serious cases, nodules and deep pustules as well as cysts may also develop. Acne vulgaris can lead to substantial social and psychological problems including reduced self-esteem, heightened anxiety, depression, and mood disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Its chief clinical treatments include antibiotics and isotretinoin, but these can be limited in their usefulness and acceptability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, treatments are often difficult and inconvenient to use, time-consuming, and can be expensive, and post-treatment relapse is common; as a result, compliance may be poor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In isotretinoin treatment, relapse rates are relatively low if the drug is administered with a sufficient cumulative dose of over 120&#x02013;150&#x02009;mg/kg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, but some patients are unable to tolerate side effects such as cheilitis, xerosis, epistaxis, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated blood cholesterol. The drug is also contraindicated in many patients due to its teratogenic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In antibiotic treatment, the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is an ongoing concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As such, novel treatment modalities are needed in order to provide alternatives and complements for the existing therapeutic options.</p><p id="Par3">Sebaceous glands and <italic>Cuticobacterium acnes</italic> bacteria are central to the development of acne. Proliferation of <italic>C. acnes</italic> may contribute to inflammation by activating toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and TLR-4, which in turn leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), as well as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. TGF-&#x003b2; appears to be an essential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine, which can inhibit CD4+ T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammation occurring in the early phase of acne lesion development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. It can also contribute to keratinocyte growth arrest and therefore disturb microcomedone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and plays a key role in wound recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>C. acnes</italic> increases functional activity in the sebaceous glands and promotes sebum production, and is thought to be involved in acne by promoting the injury of tissue due to the release of enzymes such as lipases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These catalyze the dissolution of sebum triglycerides to glycerol and free fatty acids, leading to the influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils via chemotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. As such, preventing inflammation could be an effective treatment for acne by inhibiting <italic>C. acnes</italic> colonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-&#x003b3;) is a lipid-activated nuclear hormone receptor participating in sebaceous lipogenesis and differentiation in addition to inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Sebaceous glands express PPAR-&#x003b3;, and a number of eicosanoids are capable of triggering this transcriptional factor <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In both acne lesions and non-acne lesions of acne patients, PPAR-&#x003b3; is either low or absent in the sebaceous glands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We suggest that when PPAR-&#x003b3; is absent, sebaceous glands&#x02019; inflammatory regulation fails, and auto-inflammatory reactions are switched on. Furthermore, lipid production within acne sebaceous glands is greater than in healthy sebaceous glands. This suggests that in sebaceous glands of acne lesions, the primary effect of PPAR-&#x003b3; may be to regulate inflammation, and possibly to maintain balanced lipid production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Because of the drawbacks associated with antibiotics and isotretinoin use, many acne patients seek minimally invasive treatments such as intense pulsed light (IPL) and radiofrequency (RF) treatment to alleviate inflammatory acne and its sequelae. IPL is commonly used to treat pigmentary disorders and for epilation. Although it is sometimes used in photodynamic therapy of acne, its performance is questionable, and its efficacy and applicability require further investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Similar questions apply to intradermal RF treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of IPL, RF, and a combination of the two on <italic>C. acnes</italic> strains and using an acne-induced rabbit ear model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)</title><p id="Par6">SEM was used to examine <italic>C. acnes</italic> that had been untreated or treated with RF, IPL, or RF&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPL.

Nevertheless, the exact processes underlying their actions remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that RF reduces sebum production through the selective electrothermolytic destruction of sebaceous glands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, wherein the glands are subsequently replaced by fibrosis, leading to dermal contraction and resulting in skin tightening and pore size reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Our results demonstrate that RF energy can effectively destroy the sebaceous gland. However, histological examination could not confirm that RF induced fibrosis. At seven days post-treatment, only the infiltration of inflammatory cells would be observed. However, as there was an increase in the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;, it is likely that fibrosis and dermal remodeling will occur over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. SEM findings indicate that the energy released during RF treatment can successfully destroy <italic>C. acnes</italic>. Objective three-dimensional measurements allowed us to confirm that the volume of acne lesions was significantly lower after RF treatment. This likely occurred as a result of sebaceous gland destruction and the expulsion of debris from the skin.</p><p id="Par13">Seven days after IPL treatment, the decrease in acne lesion volume was lower compared to the volume decrease achieved using RF. This may be because of a photodynamic effect, wherein IPL activates endogenous porphyrins created by <italic>C. acnes</italic> to induce TGF-&#x003b2;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, rather than cause destruction of the sebaceous gland as in RF. Additionally, the IPL spectrum includes red light, which mediates the reduction of inflammation and promotion of wound healing and can be beneficial for acne<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. SEM confirmed that the surface of <italic>C. acnes</italic> was destroyed by IPL in this experiment. These beneficial effects of IPL may bring about clinical improvements, but these do not seem to be sufficient to reduce the number and size of lesions to the same degree as RF treatment over 7 days.</p><p id="Par14">Reduced PPAR-&#x003b3; expression levels in the acne-induced model compared to the normal control were observed. Compared to the positive control, RF and IPL treatment resulted in increased PPAR-&#x003b3; expression level, though not significantly so. When the two treatments were provided in combination, there was a statistically significant outcome. Therefore, it appears that the increase of PPAR-&#x003b3; regulates inflammation in acne lesions and aids rapid treatment outcome and recovery, particularly under combination treatment.</p><p id="Par15">Lasers, including IPL, may have an immunomodulatory effect in the treatment of inflammatory acne. A previous study showed transcription and expression of TGF-&#x003b2; for a week following RF treatment, with neocollagenesis via increased expression of type I and III collagen and upregulation of type I collagen mRNA apparent within the affected tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In our study, the TGF-&#x003b2; expression level in the acne-induced model was significantly decreased compared to the normal control expression levels. In the case of IPL treatment, TGF-&#x003b2; expression was significantly increased, with even greater level of expression achieved using the combined RF and IPL treatment. This suggests that the combination treatment could be useful in acne treatment via an immunomodulatory effect elevating TGF-&#x003b2; expression.</p><p id="Par16">Previous studies have suggested that downregulation of TNF-&#x003b1;, rather than IL-8 or TLR-2, is the most likely therapeutic target for IPL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Use of the RF on acne also resulted in attenuated TNF-&#x003b1; release in an acne model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We performed immunofluorescence microscopy to assess the release of TNF-&#x003b1; in the control and treatment groups. RF, IPL, and a combination treatment of these therapies modified TNF-&#x003b1; expression within acne lesions. We believe that treating lesions with RF or IPL can reduce TNF-&#x003b1;, and will contribute to mitigating the progression of acne lesions.</p><p id="Par17">The activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in monocytes in the skin is a major source of pathogenesis of acne vulgaris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Local inflammasomes in sebaceous units induced by <italic>C. acne</italic> mediate the production of the major inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2;, which promotes severe localized inflammation in pilosebaceous glands. Since TNF-&#x003b1; is suggested as an upstream mediator of IL-1&#x003b2;, reduced TNF-&#x003b1; expression with combination treatment of RF and IPL may reduce the secretion of IL-1&#x003b2;. Therefore, decreasing the effects of NLRP3-inflammasome may decrease inflammation induced by <italic>C. acnes</italic>.</p><p id="Par18">There are some limitations to our study stemming from our use of a rabbit ear assay (REA), which is commonly used to ascertain compound comedogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Rabbit inner ear follicles are similar to human follicles in that both possess small pili and large adjacent sebaceous glands, and the REA is sensitive to the degree that only two weeks of applying a test agent can produce erythema, desquamation, and follicular keratosis, making the model useful in studies of the causes of acne<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. During the preliminary animal study performed to establish the assay, we applied oleic acid for 6 weeks and injected <italic>C. acne</italic>. When we ceased application after the development of acne lesions, the size of the papules continued to increase for one week, as can be seen in human patients. Thereafter, spontaneous regression was evident (data not shown). However, this model is not entirely homologous concerning the characteristics of their human equivalents, with intrinsic differences in skin permeation and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Rabbit ear hyperkeratosis is different from the comedo of acne vulgaris in several ways. First, the REA features little bacterial colonization. Second, inflammatory lesions do not emerge since follicular wall rupture does not occur. Third, the horn is not as densely packed. Fourth, mechanical expulsion is easier in the case of the rabbit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Because acne lesions cannot be maintained longer than a week in the rabbit model, the influence of <italic>C. acnes</italic> is reduced with time, as continued bacterial colonization is unsuccessful. This may be due to a reduction of inflammation because of the absence of rupture of the follicular wall. Therefore, the REA is limited in that it can only be used to observe the effectiveness of treatments in the short term, as in our study&#x02019;s one-week timeframe. It is also possible that our observed outcomes may have been better than potential clinical results from a human patient&#x02019;s acne lesions, since debris can escape more easily from the rabbit model than from human skin during microneedle puncture during RF treatment.</p><p id="Par19">In conclusion, RF appears to notably reduce lesion volume when used on acne, while IPL appears to have an immunomodulatory effect. We also demonstrated that the two treatments in combination produce an additive effect. In the case of RF, although it did not produce a statistically significant outcome, there appears to be an additional slight immunomodulatory effect. When performing RF treatment, one can expect that the wound caused by needle insertion for treatment would heal quickly due to the TGF-&#x003b2; enhancement effect of the IPL. In addition, although IPL treatment is less destructive of the sebaceous gland than RF, it is believed to aid the treatment of acne through increasing TGF-&#x003b2;, decreasing TNF-&#x003b1;, and increasing PPAR-&#x003b3;. Although IPL did not yield a large reduction in volume of acne lesions themselves in seven days, its immunomodulatory effect is likely to aid the overall treatment of acne. Future trials should investigate whether it is best to perform IPL and RF at the same time, or whether they should be performed in any staggered intervals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par20">Forty 4-month-old male New Zealand white rabbits (2 to 2.5&#x02009;kg, Saeronbio, Uiwang, Korea) were used for animal experiments.
