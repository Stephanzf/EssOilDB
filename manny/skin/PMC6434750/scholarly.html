Although multiple sporadic attempts at the regional/national level have been conducted to find a solution to this menace in India, the need of the hour was the formation of a dedicated international alliance that eventuated in the creation of the South Asian Alliance against Recalcitrant CUtaneous Mycosis (SAARCUM), coordinated by Dr Sidharth Sonthalia (Dermatologist) from India, and involving participation from South Asian countries including Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Singapore. The second essential aspect of such an alliance i.e. involvement of medical specialists other than dermatology was also ensured. Today, SAARCUM is a conglomeration of dermatologists, microbiologists, epidemiologists, senior scientists involved in mycology research, internists, pediatricians, and psychiatrists. </p> <p>DERMASOURCE INDIA (DSI), a well-known venture of dermatologists and management experts, credited with holding the first ever National Dermoscopy Conclave of India in 2015 followed by focused conclaves on niche areas like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), psychodermatology, hair transplantation amongst others, and International Organizing partner for various Congresses held by different National Dermatology Associations/Societies (Nepal, University of Cairo, Spring Continental Congress of Dermatology, Tehran, and Sri Lankan College of Dermatologists â€“ SLCD) organized the <b>First International Congress of SAARCUM</b> on <b>17 <sup>th</sup> November, 2018 at Medanta â€“ The Medicity, Gurugram, India </b> [ <a href="http://www.dermasourceindia.com">www.dermasourceindia.com</a>]. </p> <p>The current DSI venture â€“First International Congress of SAARCUM â€“ was governed by multi-regional and multi-specialty approach, the bare essentials to tackle the epidemic of antifungal therapeutic failures (AFTF) overwhelming South Asia and spreading across the globe. The scientific programme was delivered by including Chairpersons, 35 Speakers [ <a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>], 2 quiz masters, and presenters of 6 shortlisted Award papers and 5 E-Posters. International faculties included representatives from the National Societies of Dermatology of Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. Experienced faculties from different specialties contributed to multiple facets of clinical mycology. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Eminent speakers at the DSI-SAARCUM Congress</p>   </div> <p>The conference was attended by 162 delegates from across the length and breadth of India, and neighboring countries including Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. While the majority of delegates were dermatologists, a substantial number hailed from internal medicine and pediatrics, a positive trend since inclusion of all primary stake-holders is imperative to win this battle against mycoses. </p> <p>The scientific proceedings started with the Award Paper session. Out of 17 abstracts received, the 6 most meritorious papers pertaining to research in cutaneous mycology were presented by the residents [ <a href="#F2">Figure 2</a>]. The DSI-SAARCUM inter-collegiate postgraduate quiz â€“ prelims were conducted and of the 11 participating teams, 4 teams were shortlisted for the finals. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2</span> </a> </div>   <p>DSI-SAARCUM Residents' Award paper session with the Judges â€“ Prof. MPS Sawhney (Head, SGT Medical College, Gurugram), Prof. Surabhi Dayal (Head, PGIMER, Rohtak), and Dr Nayani Madarasingha (Senior Joint Secretary â€“ SLCD, Sri Lanka) </p>   </div> <p>To stimulate and foster the learning potential of the delegates, DSI always holds a Pre- and Post-Test Analysis for all delegates.

In general, MIC &amp;gt;1 Î¼g/ml is vaguely taken as cut-off suggestive of <i>in vitro</i> resistance. True drug resistance (although on a rise) contributes to a small proportion of AFTF </p> </li> <li> <p>Large scale and region-specific studies to define the variations in MIC levels of antifungals in dermatophytes are essential to provide data on the emergence of true drug resistance, and quantitative contribution of resistance to AFTF </p> </li> <li> <p>Drug pharmacokinetics and drug delivery to the site of infection might outweigh the impact of a susceptibility test result </p> <p> </p><ul> <li> <p>Itraconazole is not efficacious in the treatment of palmar and plantar dermatophytoses as drug levels achieved in sweat are negligible as compared to that in sebum </p> </li> <li> <p>Topical antifungals which penetrate deeper like ciclopirox olamine show better efficacy for tinea with involvement of vellus hair. </p> </li> </ul> <p /> </li> </ul> <p /> <p> <b>Dr Abhishek Omchery</b>, <i>Consultant Dermatologist, Gurugram</i>, further elaborated on " <b>Mycological vs clinical resistance</b>." </p> <p> </p><ul> <li> <p>Mycological resistance:</p> <p> </p><ul> <li> <p>Primary or intrinsic: inherently resistant strain acquired from the external milieu</p> </li> <li> <p>Secondary: inherently resistant variant(s) is/are selected from a heterogeneous population or the susceptible strain mutates during treatment. </p> </li> </ul> <p /> </li> <li> <p>The 90â€“60 rule: Infections due to <i>in vitro</i> susceptible isolates would respond to appropriate therapy in âˆ¼90% of cases, whereas infections due to resistant isolates would respond in âˆ¼60% of cases. <i>In vitro</i> resistance may not always predict the treatment outcome </p> </li> <li> <p>The time frame for suspecting a resistant fungal infection, despite giving an adequate dose and duration of treatment (having ruled out immunological and extraneous factors) should be taken as 4 weeks. </p> </li> </ul> <p /> <div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"> <p> <b>PSYCHODRAMA ROLE PLAY</b> </p> </div> <p>Akin to all CMEs organized by team DSI, a 10-minute session of PSYCHODRAMA ROLE PLAY was held â€“ the easiest and most effective mode of communicating a serious issue in a lighter vein. Enacted by <b>Dr Deepak Jakhar</b> and <b>Dr Sidharth Sonthalia</b>, this role play highlighted the dual consternation of skewed health awareness-empowerment of the new generation of patients, and the raging issue of topical steroid abuse contributing to antifungal therapy failures. </p> <div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"> <p> <b>Session II: BACK TO THE LABORATORY</b> </p> <p> <b>Chairpersons: Dr. Ajay Chopra</b> (Prof &amp;amp; Head, Dermatology, ACMS, New Delhi) </p> <p>â€ƒ <b>Dr. Anil Agarwal</b> (Senior Consultant Dermatologist, Gurugram) </p> <p>â€ƒ <b>Dr. Surabhi Dayal</b> (Prof &amp;amp; Head, Dermatology, PGIMER, Rohtak) </p> </div> <p> <b>Dr Shukla Das</b>, <i>Director-Professor, Department of Microbiology and Incharge â€“ Mycology Unit, UCMS-GTBH, Delhi </i> enlightened everyone with less-known aspects of " <b>Clinico-mycological evidence and host immune responses in chronic cutaneous mycoses</b>." </p> <p> </p><ul> <li> <p>Mycological and clinical cure as a target for complete cure should be the focus of all clinicians </p> </li> <li> <p>Dysregulated host immune responses are an important factor for resistant tinea infections</p> </li> <li> <p>The immune system tailors protective responses according to the microbial challenges, governed by different cytokines in the environment and the strength of T cell receptor â€“antigen interactions. Dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells can differentiate into classical Th1/Th2/Th17 or Tfh and iTreg cells </p> </li> <li> <p>Cell-mediated immunity can eliminate fungi but poor delayed type hypersensitivity or immune defects can prevent fungal clearance from the skin </p> </li> <li> <p>High IL-4 expressed due to sensitization to fungal antigen leads to high IgE (Th 1 â€“ 2 shift), which leads to chronicity of the fungi </p> </li> <li> <p>IL-23 R is critical in enhancing Th17 population and promotes tissue inflammation, while Tregs maintain tolerance by their suppressive activity.

After 40 min, the peel was washed off with distilled water followed by application of 8% ciclopirox olamine (CPO) or amorolfine nail lacquer </p> </li> <li> <p>Peel sessions, given weekly for 4 weeks and fortnightly for the next 4â€“6 months with daily self-application of CPO lacquer by the patient at night have shown clinical improvement at 4 weeks and complete mycological cure by 6 months. The first report of cure of toe nail onychomycosis with this protocol has been recently published. </p> </li> </ul> <p /> <div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"> <p> <b>Session VII: THE NON-DERMATOLOGY SPECIALISTSâ€™ PERSPECTIVE</b> </p> <p> <b>Chairpersons: Dr. Tejinder Kaur</b> (Professor, GMC, Amritsar) </p> <p>â€ƒ <b>Dr. TA Rana</b> (Senior Consultant Dermatologist, Noida) </p> </div> <p> <b>Dr Jyoti Bhaskar</b>, <i>Senior Consultant Gynecologist and Obstetrician, Max Super Specialty Hospital, New Delhi </i> spoke on " <b>Approach to treatment in Vulvovaginal Candidiasis</b>." </p> <p> </p><ul> <li> <p>70â€“75% women in child-bearing age group have at least a single episode of vaginal discharge with a diagnosis of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis (VVC) in 40â€“60% cases. Recurrent VVC (RVVC) is becoming a nightmare for patients and doctors alike </p> </li> <li> <p>Culture and wet microscopy is essential for diagnosis of recurrent thrush</p> </li> <li> <p>Risk factors for RVVC â€“ Pregnancy, immunocompromised states like diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus infection. Iron deficiency is an often ignored factor that must be looked for and corrected </p> </li> <li> <p>Induction and maintenance therapy is the preferred treatment as recommended by all international guidelines. Induction phase: Tab fluconazole 150â€“200 mg, 3 doses 72 h apart. Maintenance phase: 6 months of weekly fluconazole is the most commonly recommended treatment. The suspected efficacy is only 42.9% after 12 months </p> </li> <li> <p>Indian data clearly shows increased azole resistance and appearance of <i>non-albicans candida</i> species (esp. <i>C glabrata</i>) in VVC. Hence, every case of recurrent VVC should be evaluated by a culture and <i>in vitro</i> susceptibility testing should be used to guide the treatment especially for non- <i>albicans</i> candidiasis </p> </li> <li> <p>Ciclopirox olamine, boric acid suppositories (600 mg once a day for 14 days) offer better clinical and mycological cure rates than azoles as proved in various studies. Boric acid vaginal tablets are not yet available in India. Although they can be easily procured through the internet as "pH-D" vaginal suppositories </p> </li> <li> <p>Intimate hygiene washes may alter normal vaginal flora and increase local dryness and are not preferred for routine usage </p> </li> <li> <p>Probiotics with <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>L rhamnosus</i>, and <i>L reuteri</i> may offer short-term benefits. </p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p> <b>Dr Lipy Gupta</b>, <i>Senior Consultant Dermatologist, New Delhi</i> and <b>Dr Monica Bambroo</b>, <i>Senior Consultant and Head of Dermatologyt, Artemis Hospital, Gurugram</i>, moderated the session on " <b>Dialogues from across Specialties</b>" with following panelists: </p> <div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"> <p> <b>Dr Dheeraj Shah (Professor of Pediatrics, UCMS &amp;amp; Chief Editor â€“ Indian Pediatrics)</b> </p> <p> <b>Dr Jyoti Bhaskar (Senior Consultant OBGYN, Max Hospital, Delhi-NCR)</b> </p> <p> <b>Dr Jyoti Kapoor (Head of Psychiatry, Paras Hospital, Gurugram)</b> </p> <p> <b>Dr Neelam Mohan (Director, Ped. Gastroenterology &amp;amp; Hepatology, Medanta, Gurugram)</b> </p> <p> <b>Dr Sushila Kataria (Director, Dept. of Internal Medicine, Medanta, Gurugram)</b> </p> </div> <p>The key highlights of the session were:</p> <p> </p><ul> <li> <p>In tinea patients with multiple comorbidities, terbinafine and fluconazole are preferred systemic antifungal agents. Itraconazole is the only affordable treatment option for invasive fungal infections and should not be used for superficial mycoses </p> </li> <li> <p>Baseline liver function tests repeated after 6 weeks of therapy are recommended for systemic antifungal treatment. Preferred oral treatment for a patient of erythrodermic tinea with deranged liver functions â€“ terbinafine with hepatoprotective agents such as silymarin 140 mg BD and/or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) 400 mg BD, with close monitoring of liver functions </p> </li> <li> <p>Terbinafine oral granules are US-FDA approved for use in <i>Tinea capitis</i> in children aged â‰¥4 years and griseofulvin for &amp;gt;2 years. Due to non-availability of terbinafine oral granules in South Asia, the 250 mg tablet has to be divided or 125 mg dispersible tablet can be used </p> </li> <li> <p>Dermoscopy is a useful method for dermatophytic diagnosis and avoids scraping related anxiety in children </p> </li> <li> <p>Topical antifungals are preferred for treatment of fungal infections in pregnant women. Ciclopirox olamine cream obviates the need for topical steroids due to its potent anti-inflammatory activity </p> </li> <li> <p>Oral terbinafine is pregnancy category B and can be used in extensive cases, especially after 1 <sup>st</sup> trimester </p> </li> <li> <p>Dermatologists often tend to underestimate the psychological disturbances (depression, anxiety) present in patients with complicated tinea. Psychological well-being must be an important consideration in patients with chronic and recalcitrant dermatophytoses </p> </li> <li> <p>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score, a 2-min OPD evaluation can be easily used in every skin clinic to assess patient's reaction to the problem and the need for psychiatry consult </p> </li> <li> <p>Escitalopram and desvenlafaxine are the newer anti-depressant medications that can be safely used with lesser risk of side-effects and drug interactions and a rapid response within 1â€“2 weeks. </p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p> <a href="#F3">Figure 3</a> gives a glimpse into the scientific proceedings of the Congress. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 3</span> </a> </div>   <p>Glimpses of the Congress</p>   </div> <p>The Congress concluded with the Quiz Finale in which the four Quiz teams that were shortlisted after the Prelims fought it out for the crown [ <a href="#F4">Figure 4</a>]. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 4</span> </a> </div>   <p>Postgraduate Quiz Prelims and Finale with Quiz masters â€“ Dr Poonam Sharma (Senior Consultant, SISD, New Delhi) and Dr Sushruta Kathuria (Specialist, VMMC-Safdarjung hospital) </p>   </div> <div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"> <p> <b>Future Directives from the First International Congress of SAARCUM</b> </p> </div> <p> </p><ul> <li> <p>Formalization of <b>DSI-SAARCUM</b> into a registered organization with a set of goals and deadlines for regional cooperation </p> </li> <li> <p>Regional multicentric <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> trials to be planned to generate evidence on antifungal susceptibility patterns with inter-specialty collaboration </p> </li> <li> <p>Nationwide and South Asian Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ventures, with Union Ministry of Health funding and logistics support on Flagship program of " <b>Dermatology for All</b>," that would undertake three responsibilities: </p> <p> </p><ol> <li> <p> <b>DERMATOLOGY UPDATES:</b> CME's conducted by Dermatologists to train the GPs in a controlled way â€“ sharing with them the protocols of ensuring cure for tinea patients including a complete stoppage of prescribing steroid-based topicals; while also telling them about the red herrings for referral to dermatologist </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>DSI TAFOSTASAG-0:</b> The DSI Task Force to Stop Abuse of Steroid topicals At Ground Zero â€“ Random checks conducted at as many pharmacies as possible to identify the defaulters and warn/punish them through proper channel </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>DSI-IST TELEDERMATOLOGY INITATIVE:</b> In absence of any current guidelines, DSI, in alliance with the International Society of Teledermatology has formulated a Programme of Action of materializing this potential tool, to extend the benefit to distant and offshoot areas. </p> </li> </ol> <p /> </li> </ul> <p /> <p>Overall, the First International Congress of SAARCUM not only apprised the delegates of the reasons underlying the failure of our attempts to contain the fungal epidemic, the take home messages from the talks included the proper approach to a patient with tinea and ideal management, pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological. More importantly, the Congress served the purpose of bringing together Dermatologists from South Asian countries and physicians from other specialties to join hands and strategize to defeat the menace as a dedicated alliance. </p> <div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"> <p> <b>N.B.
