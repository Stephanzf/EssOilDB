Intravenous soybean oil-based parenteral fat can exacerbate the risk of IFALD while intravenous fish oil can minimize its progression, yet the mechanisms by which soybean oil harms and fish oil protects the liver are uncertain. Properties that differentiate soybean and fish oils include &#x003b1;-tocopherol and phytosterol content. Soybean oil is rich in phytosterols and contains little &#x003b1;-tocopherol. Fish oil contains abundant &#x003b1;-tocopherol and little phytosterols. This study tested whether &#x003b1;-tocopherol confers hepatoprotective properties while phytosterols confer hepatotoxicity to intravenous fat emulsions. Utilizing emulsions formulated in the laboratory, a soybean oil emulsion (SO) failed to protect from hepatosteatosis in mice administered a PN solution enterally. An emulsion of soybean oil containing &#x003b1;-tocopherol (SO+AT) preserved normal hepatic architecture. A fish oil emulsion (FO) and an emulsion of fish oil containing phytosterols (FO+P) protected from steatosis in this model. Expression of hepatic acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x003b3;), was increased in animals administered SO. ACC and PPAR&#x003b3; levels were comparable to chow-fed controls in animals receiving SO+AT, FO, and FO+P. This study suggests a hepatoprotective role for &#x003b1;-tocopherol in liver injury induced by the enteral administration of a parenteral nutrition solution. Phytosterols do not appear to compromise the hepatoprotective effects of fish oil.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006955</institution-id><institution>Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32DK104525-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fell</surname><given-names>Gillian L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006955</institution-id><institution>Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HL007734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dao</surname><given-names>Duy T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006955</institution-id><institution>Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HL007734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Meredith A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006955</institution-id><institution>Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T35HL110843</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1440-0019</contrib-id><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Bennet S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1440-0019</contrib-id><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Bennet S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by: GLF: National Institutes of Health, Grant 1F32DK104525-01; MAB and DTD: National Institutes of Health, Grant 5T32HL007734; BSC: National Institutes of Health, Grant T35HL110843, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Training Grant (no number).

PN is a critical component of therapy for patients with intestinal failure (IF) who are unable to absorb sufficient nutrients ingested orally due to inadequate intestinal length or intestinal malfunction. Although PN is life sustaining for IF patients, there are complications associated with its administration. One such complication is the development of intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), which is characterized by cholestatic liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease necessitating liver transplantation. Traditionally, the progression of IFALD could only be stopped if patients could wean off PN and achieve enteral autonomy. More recently, it has been demonstrated that use of fish oil as a parenteral fat source can prevent PN-induced liver injury in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and reverse cholestasis and stop or slow the progression of liver disease in patients with IFALD [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Fat is an important component of PN. Fat in PN is an energy-dense calorie source as well as a source of the long-chain polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (EFA), which include those from the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid families. Administration of fat-free PN requires excess carbohydrate calories to meet caloric demand. Provision of fat-free PN also results in the development of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), which may be characterized by dermatitis, hair loss, developmental delay, and growth impairment [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PN-dependent patients can be biochemically monitored for EFAD through serum fatty acid profiling and measurement of the ratio of the nonessential omega-9 fatty acid mead acid, which is a triene, to the essential omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid, which is a tetraene. The biochemical definition of EFAD is a triene to tetraene ratio greater than 0.2 [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Fat in PN is administered as an oil-in-water emulsion in which the oil is dispersed as globules surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer within an aqueous medium. Globules must be small enough to travel in the circulation without causing embolic events. In the United States, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has set standards that intravenous fat emulsions must have a mean globule size of less than 500nm in diameter and a percentage of fat globules greater than 5&#x003bc;m in diameter (PFAT5) of no more than 0.05% [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The types and proportions of fatty acids administered are determined by the composition of the oils used to formulate the emulsion. Oils may also contain naturally occurring non-triglyceride components or additives that are incorporated into emulsions formulated with such oils.</p><p>Soybean oil-based fat emulsions (SO) are the most commonly used parenteral fat sources. Until recently in the United States, the only parenteral fat sources approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contained soybean oil. Exposure to SO can exacerbate the risk of developing PNALD [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Conversely, intravenous fish oil emulsions (FO) have been shown to prevent (1, 2) PN-induced liver injury in animal models. When administered as the sole parenteral fat source to patients who develop IFALD, FO can reverse cholestasis and stop the progression of liver disease (3&#x02013;9). While the mechanisms for the hepatoprotective properties of FO and hepatotoxic properties of SO are not completely understood, there are several differences between fish oil and soybean oil that may be important contributors to the differential effects of SO and FO on the liver.</p><p>Soybean oil is naturally abundant in phytosterols, which are plant-based sterol compounds. The commercially available SO contains approximately 450mg/L of phytosterols [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The predominant phytosterol in the commercial SO is beta-sitosterol, comprising ~70% of the total phytosterols [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Stigmasterol and campesterol are present in smaller, but significant quantities, ~15% and ~13% respectively [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that stigmasterol can inhibit the expression of the bile acid transporter Farsenoid X Receptor (FXR) as well as genes modulated by FXR [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a murine model of IFALD, stigmasterol could exacerbate liver injury, suppress activation of bile acid transporters, and cause hepatic macrophage activation [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast to SO, FO contains only trace amounts of phytosterols, which could represent one mechanism for the hepatoprotective properties of FO.</p><p>Alpha-tocopherol is an anti-oxidant that is an important additive in fish oil to prevent oxidation of the long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids. Soybean oil contains fewer omega-3 fatty acids than fish oil and does not require the addition of &#x003b1;-tocopherol to maintain stability. It has been shown that &#x003b1;-tocopherol has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a preterm piglet model of IFALD, &#x003b1;-tocopherol added to commercial SO improved bile acid clearance that was impaired with the administration of SO alone [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that &#x003b1;-tocopherol contributes hepatoprotective properties and phytosterols contribute hepatotoxic properties to intravenous fat emulsions. In order to test this hypothesis, it is not possible to utilize commercially available intravenous fat emulsions, as SO and FO with varying levels of phytosterols and &#x003b1;-tocopherol do not exist. Therefore, we formulated emulsions in the laboratory to allow for both control of the amount of &#x003b1;-tocopherol and phytosterols in each emulsion and to ensure uniformity of all emulsion components with variation in only the oil type. We have previously demonstrated that SO and FO formulated in the laboratory are safe and well tolerated in mice [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Cyp7a1, a regulator of bile acid synthesis, as well as the regulators of bile acid transport FXR and small heterodimer protein (SHP) demonstrated altered expression with administration of phytosterol-containing intravenous lipids that was at least partially normalized in the setting of IV FO or SO+AT administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217155.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Cyp7a1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217155.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) decreased with the PN diet. Its expression further decreased with enteral PN and intravenous phytosterol-containing lipids. Alpha-tocopherol addition to SO appeared to partially normalize its expression. FXR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217155.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) was decreased in the enteral PN groups, with SO demonstrating even lower expression compared to FO. Although there was some normalization of FXR expression in the SO_AT group, this did not reach statistical significance. SHP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217155.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) was increased in PN fed animals receiving phytosterol-containing lipids. Other regulators of bile acid transport were assayed without particular patterns of expression with respect to phytosterol and &#x003b1;-tocopherol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217155.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Overall there was little correlation between expression of these regulators of bile acid synthesis and histologic findings.</p><fig id="pone.0217155.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0217155.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Expression of regulators of bile homeostasis with expression altered by phytosterol-containing intravenous lipids, and at least partially normalized by &#x003b1;-tocopherol.</title><p>Data are expressed as fold difference in expression compared to the chow-fed control group.

Serum and hepatic phytosterol levels are higher in PN-dependent patients receiving soybean oil-containing intravenous lipid emulsions than in patients who have been weaned off PN [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, among PN-dependent patients, levels of serum and liver phytosterols positively correlate with the degree of deranged liver enzymes as well as the degree of portal inflammation and hepatic fibrosis on histologic analysis [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In neonatal PN-dependent patients, serum phytosterol levels are higher in patients who meet biochemical criteria for IFALD than in those without IFALD [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that stigmasterol, one of the principal phytosterols in SO [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], inhibits the expression of target genes of the bile acid-responsive nuclear receptor FXR [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, Ng et al found no adverse effects on bile acid clearance with the addition of beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol to commercial FO in a preterm piglet model of IFALD [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This group did show that SO-mediated deficits in bile acid clearance were ameliorated by adding &#x003b1;-tocopherol to a commercial SO [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, similar studies performed by Muto et al in a neonatal piglet model of IFALD showed no improvements in bile flow, serum bile acid concentration, or serum direct bilirubin levels with the addition of &#x003b1;-tocopherol to a commercially available SO emulsion [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In this study, an intravenous lipid emulsion formulated in the laboratory using soybean oil to which &#x003b1;-tocopherol had been added was able to preserve normal hepatic architecture and normal expression of 2 important regulators of hepatic fat metabolism in a murine model of PN-induced liver injury in which mice are enterally fed a PN solution. An intravenous lipid emulsion formulated in the laboratory using SO that did not contain added &#x003b1;-tocopherol was not able to protect from PN-induced hepatosteatosis and dysregulation of hepatic fat metabolism. These results are consistent with the findings of Ng et al; albeit in a different model of PN-induced liver injury utilizing intravenous lipid emulsions formulated in the laboratory. The conflicting findings of Muto et al, that did not find improvement in markers of cholestasis with the addition of &#x003b1;-tocopherol to a commercially available SO may have been due to a number of issues related to integration of &#x003b1;-tocopherol into SO as there was no FO control group to which to compare. Another explanation is small sample size, as their study utilized only 8 piglets per experimental group. Formulation of the intravenous lipid emulsions in the laboratory allowed for control of the formulation protocol, and use of the same instruments and ingredients to ensure all emulsions used in the study were made in precisely the same way. Here, &#x003b1;-tocopherol was added to the soybean oil prior to formulating the emulsions, which recapitulates the process for formulating commercial FO emulsions and is the way &#x003b1;-tocopherol is integrated into commercially available emulsions.</p><p>This study also identified PPAR&#x003b3; and ACC2 as genes that are dysregulated by the enteral PN diet, normalized by IV FO and &#x003b1;-tocopherol-containing SO, but not by SO alone. PPAR&#x003b3; is a transcriptional regulator of systemic and hepatic fat metabolism as well as inflammation. It has been demonstrated that the PPAR&#x003b3; agonist rosiglitazone can reduce hepatic inflammation and associated biomarkers in a methionine- and choline-deficient diet mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In mice lacking the low-density lipoprotein receptor, rosiglitazone has been shown to improve high-fat diet-induced hepatosteatosis [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Other studies have reported a positive correlation between increased PPAR&#x003b3; expression and the development of hepatosteatosis and accumulation of hepatic triglycerides in murine models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The hepatic triglyceride-accumulating STAT5 knockout mice also exhibit reduced hepatic fat accumulation upon antagonism of PPAR&#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies also suggest an adipogenic effect associated with increased expression of PPAR&#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, it has also been shown that beta-sitosterol, one of the principal phytosterols in SO, upregulates expression of PPAR&#x003b3; in a rat model of radiation-induced oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. ACC2 encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis. ACC2 expression has been shown to be upregulated in response to high-fructose conditions and normalized by treatment with the omega-3 fatty acid DHA in primary murine hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly this study did not find a hepatotoxic effect of adding phytosterols to fish oil in enteral PN-induced liver injury. One possible conclusion is that the phytosterols in soybean oil are not responsible for the soybean oil-associated hepatotoxic effects in the murine model of PN-induced liver injury. An alternative explanation is that phytosterols do have hepatotoxic properties but are unable to overcome the hepatoprotective properties of fish oil. The omega-3 fatty acids abundant in fish oil are precursors of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and fish oil is also abundant in &#x003b1;-tocopherol. These properties may offer hepatoprotection that cannot be overcome by the presence of phytosterols. While results consistent with those in this study have been observed in a preterm piglet model of IFALD [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], other <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggest that phytosterols do have hepatotoxic properties and can affect the development of cholestasis [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This study demonstrates a role for phytosterols in intravenous lipid emulsions in altering the expression of certain regulators of bile acid homeostasis, as well as the ability of &#x003b1;-tocopherol to partially normalize expression of these genes. A third possible explanation is that specific phytosterols at specific concentrations, or that a certain balance of phytosterols is required for phytosterol-associated hepatotoxic properties to occur. In this study, the composition of phytosterols added to fish oil approximated the types and amounts of phytosterols found in soybean oil.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that while the manifestation of IFALD in the clinical setting is cholestasis, the murine model utilized for these studies demonstrates steatosis. Despite differences in phenotypic expression, this murine model of steatosis induced by enteral administration of a PN solution has been utilized previously; and the FO-mediated prevention of liver injury in this murine model faithfully recapitulates the effect of FO in normalizing IFALD in the clinical setting [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217155.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, in this study, we show that genetic regulators of bile acid homeostasis are indeed altered with the administration of phytosterol-containing intravenous lipid emulsions. It may be the case that the degree of these genetic alterations in the murine model is insufficient to result in histologic or observable functional changes.</p><p>All emulsions formulated in this study protected from the development of EFAD. Traditionally linoleic (LA) and alpha-linolenic (ALA) acids, the parent omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids respectively, have been considered the EFAs. More recent data has suggested that provision of metabolites of LA and ALA, such as ARA, EPA, and DHA is sufficient to prevent the development of EFAD while ensuring adequate growth and reproduction function [<xref rid="pone.0217155.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Interestingly, this study found that serum ARA, EPA, and DHA reflected the balance of EFAs provided by the emulsion administered rather than serum LA and ALA levels.</p><p>The ability of &#x003b1;-tocopherol to render SO less hepatotoxic in a model of enteral PN-induced liver injury implies that &#x003b1;-tocopherol may be useful in the clinical management of IFALD and other similar hepatic pathologies. Currently FO may be used for the treatment of IFALD, however FO is not readily available to all patients. The benefits of &#x003b1;-tocopherol in the management of IFALD remain to be tested clinically, and it is likely that FO has additional properties, such as an abundance of omega-3 fatty acids, that render FO more beneficial than &#x003b1;-tocopherol alone. However, the results of this study suggest that &#x003b1;-tocopherol may be an option in the prevention and/or treatment of IFALD in patients for whom FO is not available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0217155.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Fat emulsions formulated in the laboratory recapitulate the effects of similar commercially available intravenous fat emulsions in a murine model of PN-induced liver injury.</title><p>Fat-free PN results in the development of steatosis over 19 days (bottom left panel).
