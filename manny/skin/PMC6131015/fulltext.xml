Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin 7-like cytokine that activates dendritic cells to promote Th2 inflammatory immune responses. TSLP is highly expressed in keratinocytes under inflammatory conditions, which suggests that it may play a critical role in the development of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. Therefore, we investigated whether cosmetic dyes influenced the production of TSLP by keratinocytes. Phloxine O, also known as D&#x00026;C Red No.27, is one of the most common red synthetic pigments and is widely used in colored cosmetics. Our results showed that Phloxine O downregulated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced production of TSLP in a murine keratinocyte cell line (PAM212). Phloxine O also suppressed TSLP expression in KCMH-1 cells, which are mouse keratinocytes that constitutively produce high levels of TSLP. To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of Phloxine O, we induced TSLP expression in mouse ear skin by topically applying MC903, a vitamin D3 analogue that is a well-known inducer of atopic dermatitis-like symptoms. Topical application of Phloxine O prevented MC903-induced TSLP production in mouse ear skin, attenuated the acute dermatitis-like symptoms and decreased serum IgE and histamine levels in mice. Suppression of TSLP expression by Phloxine O correlated with reduced expression of OX40 ligand and Th2 cytokines in mouse ear skin. Our results showed that Phloxine O may be beneficial to prevent dermatitis by suppressing the expression of TSLP and Th2 cytokines in skin.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cosmetics</kwd><kwd>TSLP</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Keratinocytes</kwd><kwd>Dermatitis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Atopic eczema, also known as eczema, is an itchy inflammatory skin condition associated with significant morbidity (<xref rid="b8-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Johansson <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Atopic eczema is a diagnostic term that is synonymous with atopic dermatitis (AD). AD is a chronic skin disease that affects a large portion of the world&#x02019;s population. AD does not specifically affect a particular age group; rather, it can occur in people of all ages. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence of AD has increased steadily, affecting 15%&#x02013;30% of urban children and 1%&#x02013;3% of adults (<xref rid="b2-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Bieber, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b3-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b20-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Odhiambo <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). AD is characterized by intense pruritus and chronic and recurrent skin irritation. AD is closely linked to immunomodulatory disorders and epidermal barrier defects, leading to increased susceptibility of suffering from allergic reactions and skin infections (<xref rid="b19-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Nutten, 2015</xref>). AD is known to be a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease characterized by a variety of clinical forms that result from the interaction of susceptibility genes, environmental factors, skin barrier integrity disorders and immunomodulatory disorders. Although both barrier damage and immunomodulatory disorders play important roles in its pathogenesis, the underlying sequence of events is still unclear (<xref rid="b14-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Leung, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is produced by various cells, such as fibroblasts, stromal cells and epithelial cells, and mediates the development and progression of skin inflammation. TSLP interconnects the innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="b9-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Kashyap <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In AD, TSLP is primarily produced by keratinocytes upon stimulation with an allergen. OX40 ligand (OX40L), which is preferentially expressed by dendritic cells stimulated with TSLP, transforms dendritic cells into promoters of atopic inflammation, stimulating a positive feedback loop that amplifies chronic Th2 inflammatory responses (<xref rid="b21-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Pulendran <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b4-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Cianferoni and Spergel, 2014</xref>). TSLP promotes the interaction of dendritic cells and T cells, which is an essential step to induce the activation of inflammatory Th2 cells and ultimately cause allergic diseases (<xref rid="b18-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Murakami-Satsutani <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the TSLP pathway is a promising target for immunotherapy in AD (<xref rid="b24-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Many dye products contain ingredients called &#x0201c;coal tar dyes&#x0201d; that are widely used in cosmetic products. Since cosmetics are applied primarily to the skin, the effects of cosmetic dyes on dermatitis are of great interest. However, the effects of cosmetic dyes on TSLP expression by the skin have not been clarified. Therefore, we investigated whether certain cosmetic dyes modulated the expression of TSLP in keratinocytes and mouse skin. In this study, we show that Phloxine O, also known as D&#x00026;C Red No. 27, downregulates TSLP production by keratinocytes, thereby reducing skin inflammatory responses in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>BALB/c mice were obtained from Orient Bio (Seoul, Korea).

Phloxine O treatment inhibited the production of TSLP by PAM212 cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="f1-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To confirm the inhibitory effects of Phloxine O on TSLP expression, KCMH-1 cells, which are mouse keratinocytes that constitutively produce high levels of TSLP (<xref rid="b23-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Segawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), were treated with Phloxine O. Phloxine O treatment decreased the production of TSLP by KCMH-1 cells (<xref rid="f1-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To determine whether Phloxine O affected cell viability, PAM212 cells were treated with Phloxine O for 24 hours, and an LDH release assay was performed. Up to 50 &#x003bc;M of Phloxine O did not induce cytotoxicity in PAM212 cells (<xref rid="f1-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated whether Phloxine O suppressed the production of TSLP <italic>in vivo</italic>. MC903 (calcipotriol) was used as an <italic>in vivo</italic> inducer of TSLP expression in mouse skin, which results in the development of an atopic dermatitis-like syndrome (<xref rid="b16-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). To examine whether Phloxine O inhibited MC903-induced TSLP expression, Phloxine O (1%) was topically applied to mouse ear skin. After 4 hours, MC903 was topically applied to the same area of ear skin. The application of Phloxine O and MC903 was repeated for 5 days. Topical treatment with Phloxine O reduced the levels of TSLP protein, induced by MC903 in mouse ear skin tissues (<xref rid="f2-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Increased levels of TSLP mRNA following MC903 application in mouse ear skin were also reduced by Phloxine O (<xref rid="f2-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). In addition, Phloxine O decreased TSLP receptor (TSLPR) mRNA levels, also increased as a result of the topical application of MC903 to mouse ear skin (<xref rid="f2-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Dexamethasone, which we used as a positive control, was effective in reducing TSLP and TSLPR mRNA levels, but it did not reduce TSLP protein levels (<xref rid="f2-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). These results demonstrate that Phloxine O inhibits the expression of TSLP in keratinocytes and in skin tissue.</p><p>To investigate whether the <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of TSLP production by Phloxine O resulted in an attenuation of TSLP-mediated dermatitis symptoms, we analyzed the inflammatory responses in mouse ear skin tissues. Topical application of MC903 on mouse ear skin once per day for 5 days led to the development of dermatitis symptoms, such as epidermal hyperplasia, edema, and accumulation of inflammatory cells in the dermis/epidermis layer, as shown by histological assessment of ear skin tissues (<xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In contrast, pretreatment with Phloxine O suppressed MC903-induced dermatitis symptoms, with an efficacy comparable to that of dexamethasone (<xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The increase in ear skin thickness induced by MC903 was reduced by Phloxine O treatment (<xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin inflammation is accompanied by an increase in serum IgE and histamine levels (<xref rid="b7-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Gao <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). While topical application of MC903 increased the levels of IgE and histamine in serum, treatment with Phloxine O significantly reduced these levels (<xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, 3D</xref>). Interestingly, dexamethasone treatment did not reduce the levels of IgE (<xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), although it did reduce histamine levels (<xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These results indicate that dermal application of Phloxine O reduced the AD-like skin allergic inflammatory responses, most likely due to inhibition of TSLP production by keratinocytes.</p><p>TSLP induces the expression of OX40L in dendritic cells which, in turn, stimulates the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Th2 cells, thereby promoting Th2-type allergic immune responses (<xref rid="b15-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Leyva-Castillo <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether Phloxine O treatment would affect the expression of OX40L and Th2 cytokines in mouse ear skin tissues exposed to MC903. Topical application of Phloxine O inhibited OX40L expression induced by MC903 in mouse ear skin tissues, a similar outcome to that seen with dexamethasone treatment (<xref rid="f4-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consistently, Phloxine O significantly reduced the expression of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, in mouse ear skin stimulated with MC903 (<xref rid="f4-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B&#x02013;4D</xref>). These results show that Phloxine O inhibits the activation of dendritic cells, thereby blocking the activation of Th2 immune responses, possibly as a result of the inhibition of TSLP production by skin keratinocytes.</p><p>Collectively, our results show that Phloxine O downregulates the expression of TSLP and Th2 cytokines in skin, resulting in the attenuation of acute dermatitis symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although persons are frequently exposed to cosmetic dyes on a daily basis, there are few studies investigating the effects of cosmetic dyes on TSLP expression. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show inhibitory effects of a cosmetic dye on TSLP production by the skin. Our results showed that Phloxine O suppressed TSLP expression both <italic>in vitro</italic> using murine keratinocyte cell lines and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a murine acute dermatitis model. TSLP expression correlated well with the acute dermatitis symptoms, since application of MC903, an <italic>in vivo</italic> inducer of TSLP, to mouse skin, resulted in an inflammatory response. In contrast, Phloxine O alleviated the acute dermatitis symptoms induced by MC903 in mice by reducing TSLP production.</p><p>Phloxine O is one of the commonest synthetic red pigments and is widely used in colored cosmetics. Phloxine O is approved by the FDA as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and is primarily used to manufacture lipsticks and blushers. Lakes containing Phloxine O are used in lipsticks, blushers, makeup preparations, hair dyes and colors, rouges, face powders, bath oils, tablets and salts (<xref rid="b22-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). An evaluation of its dermal toxicity has been reported (<xref rid="b6-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2001</xref>). In these dermal toxicity studies, Phloxine O (0.1%, 1%) was topically applied daily to the intact or abraded skin of rabbits for 28 days or 91 days. Body weight and the healing time for abraded skin were not affected by Phloxine O treatment. There were no gross or histopathological changes in the internal organs after topical treatment with Phloxine O (<xref rid="b6-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2001</xref>). Another study showed that 1% Phloxine O applied to the dorsal skin of ICR mice twice weekly for 18 months had no effect on survival and did not produce any skin lesions (<xref rid="b6-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2001</xref>). These studies show that dermal application of Phloxine O does not produce any systemic effects or local skin lesions. However, these studies did not assess the potentially beneficial effects of applying Phloxine O on the dermis. In our study, 1% Phloxine O was topically applied for 5 days to MC903treated mouse skin, and we observed an anti-inflammatory effect. Our study highlights the beneficial effects that certain cosmetic dyes can have on skin inflammation. Furthermore, these results suggest that Phloxine O may be safely used on compromised and inflamed skin.</p><p>TSLP is a well-known inducer of Th2 immune responses. Therefore, the modulation of TSLP expression may be an effective strategy to prevent atopic dermatitis symptoms, balancing Th1 and Th2 immune responses. Our previous study showed that dieckol, a phlorotannin isolated from <italic>Ecklonia cava</italic>, suppressed TSLP production in mouse skin, reduced Th2-type immunity, and alleviated atopic dermatitis-like symptoms in the NC/Nga mouse model of AD (<xref rid="b27-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>). In this study topical application of Phloxine O, a cosmetic colorant, inhibited TSLP production and downregulated Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, resulting in decreased IgE and histamine levels. These results suggest that Phloxine O can suppress exacerbated Th2-type responses and restore the Th1/Th2 immune balance.</p><p><xref rid="b5-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Cultrone <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>. showed that treatment of polarized epithelial cell lines with TLR agonists significantly upregulated TSLP expression in an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent manner. After <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, the authors identified several putative binding sites for NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 within the 4 kilobase length region of the TSLP promoter (<xref rid="b5-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Cultrone <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Similarly, our previous study showed that the suppression of TSLP production by dieckol in keratinocytes was mediated by the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. This finding suggests that the downregulation of TSLP production induced by Phloxine O may also be mediated by NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies investigating the anti-dermatitis effects of Phloxine O or the underlying cellular signaling events. Our study is the first to investigate the cytokine modulatory effects after Phloxine O treatment of keratinocytes. Additional studies are needed to understand how Phloxine O interacts with the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.</p><p>Dexamethasone was used as a positive anti-inflammatory control in our MC903-induced skin inflammation experiments. In our study, dexamethasone suppressed MC903-induced ear swelling and thickness, as shown in <xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref>, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory activity. However, it is unclear whether the anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone involved the regulation of TSLP production, since although TSLP mRNA levels decreased, TSLP protein levels were not suppressed by dexamethasone (<xref rid="f2-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>). There are few reports addressing the regulation of TSLP production by dexamethasone. In a 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB) induced mouse atopic dermatitis model mediated by TNF-&#x003b1;, topical application of 0.12% dexamethasone suppressed both TSLP mRNA and protein levels in the atopic lesion (<xref rid="b17-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Mizuno <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Dexamethasone has also been reported to suppress TSLP mRNA expression in keratinocytes induced after 6 hours by double-stranded RNA (<xref rid="b11-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Le <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In contrast, dexamethasone alone increased the expression of the TSLP receptor (TSLPR), and even enhanced IL-1/TNF-induced TSLPR expression in mast cells (MCs) and CD34+ cells (<xref rid="b1-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Allakhverdi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Dexamethasone reportedly increased IL-5 and IL-13 production in MCs, while it suppressed the production of Th2 cytokines in CD34+ cells, paradoxically suggesting that dexamethasone stimulates Th2 responses in MCs, promoting the cellular mechanisms that drive allergic inflammation (<xref rid="b1-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Allakhverdi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that dexamethasone may not be able to suppress all the cellular events induced by MC903. In our study, dexamethasone did not attenuate IgE production after applying MC903 to mouse ear skin (<xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), although histamine levels did decrease (<xref rid="f3-bt-26-481" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). There are several reports describing the paradoxical effects of glucocorticoids on allergic inflammation. <xref rid="b25-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al</italic>. (1991)</xref> showed that hydrocortisone enhanced the production of IgE in human lymphocytes stimulated with IL-4. Another study reported an increase of serum IgE levels in asthma patients treated with prednisone for 7 days, although prednisone still showed clinical efficacy against asthma (<xref rid="b29-bt-26-481" ref-type="bibr">Zieg <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). Similarly, our results showed that dexamethasone exhibited anti-inflammatory effects against MC903-induced ear skin inflammation, despite its inability to suppress IgE production <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, these results suggest that the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of dexamethasone effects on TSLP and TSLPR expression in atopic dermatitis warrants further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a grant (14172MFDS975) from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in 2016.</p></ack><fn-group><fn
