    "Phyto-chemicals are increasingly being used in the treatment of cancer because of their availability, potential anti-cancer activity with less adverse effects when compared with chemotherapy. The variation of climate and geography in South Asian countries provides a nursing environment for the growth of versatile plant species, that are repeatedly drawing attention of the scientific community. In this review, we have focused on the anti-cancer potential of thirty plants, which are commonly found in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, with their mechanisms of action. In particular, we have discussed the bio-active components that display anti-cancer activity, which have been identified in these plants. This review may help researchers to profile plants with known anti-cancer effect of this region and further investigations of anti-cancer agents in medicinal plants from South Asia."
