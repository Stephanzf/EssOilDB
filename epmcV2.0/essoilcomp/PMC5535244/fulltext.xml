Several physical and chemical methods have been reported to synthesize AgNPs. However, these methods are expensive and involve heavy chemical reduction agents. An alternative approach to produce AgNPs in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way employs a biological pathway using various plant extracts to reduce metal ions. The size control issue, and the stability of nanoparticles, remain some of the latest challenges in such methods. In this study, we used two different concentrations of fresh leaf extract of the plant <italic>Arbutus unedo</italic> (LEA) as a reducing and stabilizing agent to produce two size variations of AgNPs. UV-Vis spectroscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and zeta potential were applied for the characterization of AgNPs. Both AgNP variations were evaluated for their antibacterial efficacy against the gram-negative species <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, as well as the gram-positive species <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. Although significant differences have been achieved in the nanoparticles&#x02019; size by varying the plant extract concentration during synthesis, the antibacterial effect was almost the same.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>green synthesis</kwd><kwd>silver nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>particle size</kwd><kwd>antibacterial efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nanomaterials-07-00178"><title>1.

A similar apparatus is also found in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. </p><p>The phyto-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is a rapid, cost-effective, and easily scalable-up synthetic route. Various leaf extracts from plants like <italic>Lantana camara</italic> L.

Based on a previous work of coauthors, presenting the synthesis of AgNPs produced using the leaf extract of the plant <italic>Arbutus unedo</italic> (LEA) as a reducing and stabilizing agent [<xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we aim to extend the advantages of this low-cost and environmentally friendly method for the production of AgNPs. We also present here the development of two new products, silver nanoparticles variation 1 (NP1) and variation 2 (NP2), which are produced by varying the amount of LEA in the synthesis and leading to different size and size distribution of the products. For the first time, we investigate the antibacterial efficacy of NP1 and NP2, applying them against four bacterial strains, which are relevant for biomedical applications. We aim to gain a better insight into the complex action of AgNPs on bacterial cells, and with this perspective, to incorporate them into antibacterial biomaterial scaffolds for tissue regeneration. Furthermore, we report on the characterization of the two variations of AgNPs by means of Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and zeta potential. Moreover, we evaluate the antibacterial efficacy by applying different concentrations of both AgNPs variations against the gram-negative species <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, as well as the gram-positive species <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>.

Data Analysis</title><p>Measurements for each species were collected in triplicated 96-well plates, which were considered as different experimental blocks. OD measurements were modeled using Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMMs) in the statistical language R in two steps. First, to test for the existence of background effects, control samples (wells where pathogens were absent) were modeled using a LMM in which the dependent variable was the logOD. The fixed effects term included the moment of sampling (time) and concentration of the nanoparticle as categorical variables, as well as their interaction. The random term consisted of the triple measurements in each well (position effects), nested within each block. The function l<sub>mer</sub> of the package l<sub>me4</sub> in R was implemented [<xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Time of sampling and concentration of AgNPs had a significant effect on the OD reads, when pathogens were absent. Their interaction was significant, as well. Therefore, ordinary least square estimates of OD were extracted by the l<sub>smeans</sub> function of the l<sub>smeans</sub> package for each combination of time and concentration. These estimates were then subtracted from the experimental OD measures for the corresponding combinations of factors. The second step comprised the actual analysis, in which only samples containing pathogens were included. Experimental OD measures, resulted from subtraction of each background effect to the original measurements, were transformed as log(OD+1) and were submitted to a LMM as the dependent variable. The fixed and random components of the models were the same as in the first step. Each species was analyzed separately. Ordinary least square estimates of OD, and their corresponding standard errors, were extracted and plotted.</p><p>MIC for each species was identified as the minimum concentration of nanoparticle, for which the estimate of OD was not statistically different from the corresponding one at 0 h (Tukey pairwise comparisons were done by the implication of post hoc tests on the model estimates). MIC50 was interpolated from the graphs of OD vs. concentration [<xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Range concentrations were calculated as the minimum concentration of the nanoparticle, where the estimates of OD values were statistically lower than the estimates of OD values in the controls. Statistical significance was determined by Tukey post hoc comparisons on the corresponding LMM coefficient estimates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-nanomaterials-07-00178"><title>3.

Before concluding about the optimum conditions to produce these variations, an experimental framework was performed to establish the process parameters for attaining mono-dispersity and long-term stability. In this context, variations by mixing different doses of LEA and silver nitrate solution at various temperatures and mixing durations were considered. The particles, although discrete, were predominantly coated with the organic component forming small groups, which makes them stable over long time periods. A higher and narrower absorption band peaked at around 469 nm was observed in the case of NP1, ascribed to the greater mean size of AgNPs produced when higher amounts of the leaf extract are incorporated. As for variation NP2, the absorption band was broadened and shifted to shorter wavelengths, at approximately 458 nm, due to the smaller mean size of the AgNPs at a much wider scatter. This will be discussed in the following section. Band peaks at higher wavelengths were also observed when higher LEA concentrations were applied for reducing Ag<sup>+</sup> [<xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot2-nanomaterials-07-00178"><title>3.1.2. Size and Shape of NPs Characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering and Transmission Electron Microscopy</title><p>Two different populations were measured through DLS for variations NP1 and NP2. The population of NP1 sample was characterized by a larger mean size, amounting to 58 nm, having a very narrow scatter (standard deviation: 18.4%). This behavior can be ascribed to the double quantity of leaf extract available for reducing AgNO<sub>3</sub>, yielding to a more abrupt nucleation and faster growth of the nanoparticles, while producing small agglomerates in some cases. The population of NP2 sample has a much smaller mean size of approximately 40 nm, however, it is characterized by a broader size scatter (standard deviation: 33.6%), especially to smaller sizes. In this sample, AgNPs with a size of 5 nm were measured, and most of them were mono-dispersed. The graphs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-07-00178-f002">Figure 2</xref> were created based on the most representative populations of variations NP1 and NP2, in terms of &#x0201c;intensity&#x0201d; (solid lines) and &#x0201c;number&#x0201d; (dashed lines). The differences in the plots between &#x0201c;intensity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;number&#x0201d; are almost consistent with low polydispersion.</p><p>Representative TEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-07-00178-f003">Figure 3</xref>) show that both Ag nanoparticle variations, NP1 and NP2, are approximating a spherical shape. In the NP1 solution, we observe silver NPs with a diameter of mainly in the range of 50&#x02013;60 nm, with a descending probability at smaller sizes. In the NP2 solution, we observe silver NPs with 40 nm diameter as the dominating size, whereas less NPs at smaller diameters tend to appear, but more NPs appear with diameter &#x0003c;10 nm. This evidence is in good agreement with the DLS measurements (i.e., mean NPs size for NP1 is 58 nm, and 40 nm for NP2) at large sizes, however, DLS seems to be unable to capture the high number of very small NPs (&#x0003c;10 nm).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot3-nanomaterials-07-00178"><title>3.1.3.

The lowest AgNP concentration (0.3 &#x003bc;g/mL) had no effect in bacterial growth in both cases of AgNP variations. Higher concentrations caused a growth delay or inhibition in all tested strains.

Moreover, MIC coincided with MBC in the case of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. MIC50 was slightly lower for AgNP2 compared to AgNP1 (1.8 or 2.01 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nanomaterials-07-00178-t001">Table 1</xref>). A similar trend was observed in the case of the other gram-positive species, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>; growth was inhibited at 15 &#x003bc;g/mL (MIC) due to a bactericidal effect (MBC = 15 &#x003bc;g/mL). Again, MIC50 was slightly lower for AgNP2 than AgNP1 (6.3 or 6.6 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively). In the case of the gram-negative <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, MIC and MBC were also calculated at 15 &#x003bc;g/mL. MIC50 was found slightly lower for AgNP1 compared to AgNP2 (9 or 9.9, respectively) in the case of <italic>E. coli</italic>, but was the same (3.6) for both variations in the case of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The fact that range concentrations coincide with MICs and MBC for each species tested suggests that: (a) NPs were highly toxic to bacteria; and (b) there is a certain threshold in the number of AgNPs around the bacterial cell above which cells collapse and die. </p><p>To ensure that low MIC and MBC levels found were not due to antimicrobial properties of the plant extract used to produce AgNPs, positive controls were also tested. Specifically, bacterial growth was assessed for 24 h in wells containing a final concentration of 10% or 25% of the plant extract in the absence of AgNPs (blank formulation). Growth was found to be like that in the case of the control (0%: medium only) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-07-00178-f007">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-nanomaterials-07-00178"><title>3.4.

Discussion</title><p>Two variations of silver nanoparticles, named as NP1 and NP2, were synthesized by an eco-friendly route, exploiting the high reduction power that leaf extracts offer [<xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Through this, a minimum use of chemicals (just AgNO<sub>3</sub>) is required, minimizing the environmental impact that conventional silver nanoparticles possess. The major challenge posed by bio-synthesis methods is the stability and reproducibility of the process. However, when this is mastered, low-cost and ultra-stable nanoparticles can be produced, given that there is no need for high pressure, temperature or energy in this green fabrication process. The high stability of NP1 and NP2 shown in this study is due to the organic coating formed around the nanoparticles [<xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Silver nanoparticles stabilized with poly(<italic>N</italic>-vinylpyrrolidone) with diameters of 50 nm have been reported to have a zeta potential of &#x02212;17 mV, whereas citrate stabilized AgNPs had &#x02212;30 to &#x02212;45 mV, depending on silver concentration [<xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our results are in good agreement with a previous report, indicating a nanoparticle mean size of 50 nm and zeta potential values of &#x02212;18 and &#x02212;11 mV for NP1 and NP2. Although significant differences of charge were not observed between NP1 and NP2, the slightly lower charge of NP2 could be attributed to the lower quantity of LEA, yielding to a thinner coating on the surface of NPs.</p><p>Both variations of AgNPs were effective in vitro against the tested species, with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> being the most sensitive, comparable with efficacies reported on previous studies [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The overall antibacterial efficacy of AgNPs developed in this study against the four bacterial species yields MICs and MBCs that are comparable or in some cases, lower than those reported by other groups [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, a direct comparison between data in the literature and our results was not possible, given that starting compositions, capping agents and the resulting size of NPs differ in some cases significantly. The better activity against gram-negative species that has been reported by these groups was not observed in this study, suggesting that AgNPs activity was independent of the cell wall structure. In fact, scanning electron microscopy in time samples of liquid cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the least sensitive among the species tested, and in the presence of AgNP1, revealed that co-incubation of 5 h disrupted the integrity of the bacterial membrane and cell wall. It is known that AgNPs&#x02019; action largely relies on releasing silver ions that damage membranes and affect several biochemical processes. However, they especially interact with thiol and amino groups of proteins and induce the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), forming free radicals with strong bactericidal action [<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Most of the factors that are known to modify the antibacterial effect of AgNPs, such as size, shape, stability, and concentration [<xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] were evaluated in this study. The size-dependent activity of AgNPs attributed to a relative increase of the surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles and the contact surface area has been reported by other research groups [<xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The larger size of NP1 compared to NP2 shown in our work, similar to nanoparticles synthesized by other groups [<xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], did not seem to have a significant effect on the overall efficacy. However, a slight difference in the bactericidal activity in favor of AgNP2 was observed in SEM figures, suggesting a slight elevation in bactericidal activity that could not be observed in the kinetics of growth (inhibition was the same), or impact MBC calculations.</p><p>It should be noted that some agglomeration of nanoparticles was observed after incubation, which was resolved by mild sonication. Such an agglomeration was more evident after co-incubation of AgNPs with the pathogens, due to the additional binding of nanoparticles to cell debris. Since nanoparticles are known to absorb biomolecules and agglomerate in the biological mediums that are usually tested [<xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], their efficacy might be different in dry surfaces, which could be the subject of another study. </p><p>Our results showed a strong bactericidal effect of synthesized AgNPs that can be translated into a biomedical application of great potential. This could address the shortage of new antimicrobials against the emerging antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, which are mostly gram-negative bacteria. In addition, the green synthesis offers a one-step fabrication and stabilization of the nanoparticles, since the plant extract reduces Ag<sup>+</sup> to Ag<sup>0</sup>, and the material constituents act as capping agents to the system, simultaneously adding biocompatible functionalities into these NPs for enhancing further biological interactions [<xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The low toxicity of such NPs in mammalians reduces environmental risks, such as acute toxic effects or bioaccumulation [<xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-07-00178" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nanomaterials-07-00178"><title>5.

Both variations were evaluated for their antibacterial efficacy against the gram-negative species <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and the gram-positive species <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. All four bacterial strains were tested sensitively against both variations of AgNPs due to bacterial membrane disruption as indicated by microscopy. Although the nanoparticles&#x02019; size between the two variations was different, their antibacterial effect was similar in all investigated strains.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors Anthie Georgopoulou and Maria Chatzinikolaidou acknowledge financial support from the Excellence Grant. &#x02018;Aristeia II Osteobiomimesis 3438&#x02019; of the Greek General Secretary for Research and Technology.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Nicholas Skandalis designed and conceived the efficacy evaluation experiments.
