    "Slow plant growth, low biomass, and low bioavailability of heavy metals in soil are important factors that limit remediation efficiencies. This study adopted a pot cultivation method to evaluate the phytoremediation efficiency of Neyraudia reynaudiana, planted in contaminated soil from a lead-zinc mining area. The soil was inoculated with earthworms (Eisenia fetida), and mixed with the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) one month after planting. The addition of earthworms significantly increased the aboveground biomass of N. reynaudiana and activated heavy metals in the soil, thus facilitating heavy metal uptake by N. reynaudiana. The addition of EDTA significantly increased the incorporation and transport of heavy metals, reduced the uptake of heavy metals by the plant cell wall, and increased the proportions of cellular soluble constituents. Especially with regard to lead, inoculation with earthworms and EDTA application significantly promoted the accumulation efficiency of N. reynaudiana, increasing it 7.1-16.9-fold compared to the control treatment without earthworms and EDTA, and 1.5-2.3-fold compared to a treatment that only used EDTA."
