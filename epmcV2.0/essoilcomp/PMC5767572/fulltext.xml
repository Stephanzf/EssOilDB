There is a dynamic system that involves the interaction between weeds, crops, humans and environment. According to different definitions of weed &#x02013; a plant growing where it is not wanted, a plant out of place, a plant growing where it is desired that something else growth, those plants with harmful or objectionable habits. Therefore, it can be summarized that weeds are those uninvited plants which are grown in undesirable place and period causing competition for cultivated crops and economic loss. Invasive plant species not only change the dynamics of species composition and biodiversity but also hamper the system productivity and efficiency in invaded regions [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Besides rapidly colonizing areas replacing the native vegetation, it is also known to cause a number of human health problems, environmental degradation including threat to tourism activities [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The characteristics that make a plant weed are- (1) long seed life in the soil, (2) quick mergence, (3) rapid early growth, (4) no special environmental requirements for germination, (5) ability to survive and prosper under disturbed condition. Organizations engaged in invasion research defined invasive species as a species that is not native to the ecosystem under consideration whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health, species, subspecies or lower taxon, introduced outside its natural past or present distribution; includes any part, gametes, seeds, eggs, or propagates of such species that might survive and subsequently reproduce, animals, plants or other organisms introduced by man into places out of their natural range of distribution, where they become established and disperse, generating a negative impact on the local ecosystem and species, an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health (Invasive Species Advisory Council, 2001). In India, exotic weeds, especially <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> in urban areas<italic>, Lantana camara</italic> in forestlands, and <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> in croplands, have assumed the proportion of noxious biological pollutants. Each of these three natives of tropical America has wide ecological amplitude. Because of ecological, agricultural, environmental, and health hazards for cattle and man, the respective governments of the states as well as the union government of India are trying hard to assess the damage and find a solution for their control [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Twelve sustainable weed management strategies are described as [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]: Know the weeds on your farm, Plant cropping systems to minimize open niches to weeds, keep the weed guessing, design the cropping system and select tools for effective weed control, grow vigorous, competitive crops, put the weeds out of work-grow cover crops, manage the weed seed bank, minimize deposition and maximize withdrawals, Know the weeds out at critical time, utilize biological processes to enhance weed control, bring existing weeds under control before planting sensitive crops and long term perennial crops, keep observing the weeds and adapt practices accordingly. In India, <italic>Parthenium</italic> it was testified that it cause 40% damages in yield of agricultural crops [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] whereas in Australia, an yearly damage of $16.8 million to the cattle industry was valued due to presence of this weed in grasslands [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Crop likes black gram (<italic>P. mungo</italic>), throughout first 30&#x02013;45&#x0202f;days after crop planting, the existence of this weed caused significant yield losses, therefore management of this weed is essential [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Keep up on new development and practices have been done but for the developing countries, the use of organic manure on crop will not only improve the soil properties but will also cut down on the foreign exchange need for the purchase of mineral fertilizers. Weeds are available plenty but they are not wanted [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Weeds are unwanted plants but which can be converted into valuable resources and available free of cost growing without cultivation, irrigation and protecting the soil by giving of a warm soil cover. A farmer can produce his individual vermicompost from the biodegradable waste like weeds, made their own farm and need not spend extra money to purchase the raw material of vermicompost. Chemical fertilizers have been one of the major components of modern agriculture. Use of chemicals has now raised many questions related to the productivity of land and continuously increasing cost of cultivation. Vermicompost technology has been solved many problems. Earthworms have been known as farmer&#x02019;s friends for long (Darwin, 1881). Vermicompost technology is converting all biodegradable waste into plant nutrient rich organic manure with the help of composting.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Allelopathy</title><p id="par0035">Allelopathy is an important mechanism of plant interference by the addition of plant-produced phytotoxins to the environment. Many of the phototoxic substance suspected of causing germination and growth inhibition have been identified from plant tissues and soil, these substances are termed allelochemics or allelochemicals. Allelochemistry, the production and release of toxic chemicals produced by one species that affect a receiving susceptible species, has been the subject of diverse degrees of scientific enquiry. Recent advances in plant biology have permitted the revamp of allelochemistry as a biologically and ecologically sound explanation for plant invasion and plant&#x02013;plant communication in the rhizosphere. Recent progress has been made in understanding the biochemical and molecular changes that are induced by allelochemicals in susceptible plant species, and the complex mechanisms that are used by allelochemical-resistant plants to defend against this toxic insult [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Terrestrial weeds</title><p id="par0040">Terrestrial weeds which are evident in India and many other parts of the world causing economic and environmental threats are <italic>Lantana camara, Ageratum conyzoides, Parthenium hysterophorus, Galinsoga purviflora, Saccharum spontaneum, Argemone Mexicana</italic>.</p><sec id="sec0020"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Lantana camara</title><p id="par0045"><italic>Lantana camara</italic> is the one of the ten worst weeds of the world belonging to the family Verbenaceae. Lantana forms huge dense thickets on the floor of forest and plantation areas due to its scrambling growth patterns and bushy nature which hampers normal function of the forest and the growth and development of other underlying vegetation (Iyenger 1933; Singh et al., 1988) as reported in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Native of Central and South America, it is an evergreen aromatic shrub [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In India it was introduced during 1809&#x02013;1810 as an ornamental plant in Calcutta&#x02019;s gardens [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Now all over India this weed is commonly found. More than 13.2 million ha pasture land and other areas in India had been invaded by <italic>Lantana</italic> [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This weed has replaced <italic>Quercus leucotrichphora</italic> and <italic>Pinus roxburghii</italic> forests in Kumaun hills (U.P.) [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; invaded the Teak plantations in Tamil Nadu; covered Western Ghats (South India) [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and heart water region of Garhwal (U.P.) [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The cost of <italic>Lantana</italic> management is US$ 70 per hectare and is harmful to herbivores [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The soil of <italic>Lantana</italic> invaded and non-invaded when analysed edaphic factors such as soil pH, total nitrogen, soil organic carbon, phosphorus and potassium content positively influenced the growth of <italic>Lantana</italic> and helped in the further invasion process. <italic>Lantana</italic> invasion can not only significantly improve the soil nutrient level but also positively increase the chances of its further invasion with more copious plant attributes Mandal et al., 2014. Due to fitness homeostasis, phenotypic plasticity, widespread geographical range, modes of reproduction and ultimately none and the most potent, the phenomenon of allelopathy <italic>Lantana</italic> is highly invasive Sharma et al., 2005. Some other allelochemicals identified in <italic>Lantana camara</italic> are cytotoxic in nature found in the leaves are lantadene A and lantadene B [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In forest due to allelopathy, <italic>Lantana</italic> density increases due to which species richness declines [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Allelochemicals present in <italic>Lantana</italic> hampers the vigourness of native plants of a particular region and ultimately results into poor productivity [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Wild fire in many forest rich parts of India is also caused due to <italic>Lantana</italic> invasion [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The stem, leaf and fruit leachates of <italic>Lantana</italic> inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of some terrestrial plants [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The management of <italic>Lantana</italic> expansion in forest and cultivable lands is a big challenge for scientific community and policy maker Suthar et al., 2013.

It belongs to the plant family Asteraceae. It is widely distributed tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Commonly found in cultivated areas, pasture land, road sides interfering with native plants. The plant is now found as a weed of over 36 crops (including plantations) in 46different countries [<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has been ranked as 19th of the world's worst weeds [<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic>Ageratum conyzoides,</italic> a native of Central America and the Caribbean, is now found throughout the world [<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The special feature of <italic>Asteraceae</italic> plant family is that the flowers massed together in a head, a special kind of inflorescence having advantage to attract pollinators for cross-pollination that helps in increase in population in a short period of time. Also effective seed dispersal mechanism by parachute like special organ developed on the fruit helps in long distance dispersal of the seeds. The large seed producing capacity helps this weed for rapid colonization and thus it invades easily. It produces a large number (8000&#x02013;10000/plant) of fruits (achene) that have a pappus. These are easily disseminated by air, water and animals. The seeds are photoblastic and remain viable for one year [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These morphological characteristics are advantage for easy dispersion of this plant species that leads to rapid invasion. Absence of natural predators and high reproductive potential attributes to successful invasion. The yield of staple crops like rice, wheat, corn etc. has been reported to be diminished due to invasion of <italic>Ageratum.</italic> When it invades rangeland areas, it out competes native grasses causing scarcity of fodder [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Due to hindrance in field practices like ploughing, maintenance cost of croplands is increased by the growth of these weeds [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the lower Shivalik range of the Himalayas due to infestation of cultivated lands by this weed to a great extent that led to leaving of farmers their agricultural fields. A wide range of chemical compounds including alkaloids, flavonoids, chromenes, benzofurans and terpenoids have been isolated from this species. Extracts and metabolites from this plant have been found to possess pharmacological and insecticidal activities [<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Both the volatile oil and the aqueous extract of the <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> have been shown to have allelopathic effects on a number of cultivated crops. Through volatilizing, leaching, and residue decomposion into the environment many kinds of allelochemicals are released by A conyzoides. The saturated aqueous solution of the isolated and purified precocene I and II have been reported to have significant inhibitory effect on the seedling growth of radish, tomato and ryegrass [<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Its allelopathic potential varied with growth stages and environmental conditions. It releases more volatile allelochemicals (ageratochromene and its derivatives, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and flavones) under adverse conditions [<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0030"><label>2.1.3</label><title>Parthenium hysterophorus</title><p id="par0055"><italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> is considered as one of the worst weed of the world. The plant belongs to the plant family Asteraceae, commonly known as Congress Grass. Native to southern United States, Mexico and Central and South America, it has been accidentally introduced into several countries and has become a serious agricultural and rangeland weed in parts of Australia, Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands, as presented in <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Almost every part of India this weed is prevailing. Wide adaptability, photo- and thermo-insensitivity, drought tolerance, strong competition and allelopathy, high seed production ability, longevity of seeds in soil seed banks, and small and light seeds that are capable of long distance travel via wind, water, birds, vehicles, farm machinery and other animal traffic, contribute to its rapid introduction world-wide, cutting across national boundaries and climate barriers. Due to its high fecundity a single plant can produce 10,000 to 15,000 viable seeds and these seeds can disperse and germinate to cover large areas. The allelopathic effect reduces crop production drastically. The biodiversity also threatened by aggressive dominance by this noxious weed. Many allergic respiratory problems, contact dermatitis, mutagenicity in human and livestock are reported to be caused by this weed [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The allelopathic effect of this weed is evident by various experiments carried out over the time. <italic>Parthenium</italic> weed is capable of interfering with the growth of neighboring seedlings even at very early stages of growth. <italic>Parthenium</italic> extracts contain allelopathic effect which could affect the seed germination and elongation of Onion and Bean demonstrated by an experiment carried out to evaluate the effect <italic>of P. hysterophorus</italic> on germination and elongation of Onion <italic>(Allium cepa)</italic> and Bean <italic>(Phaseolus vulgaris)</italic> [<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A study carried out on the effect of <italic>Parthenium</italic> root extract on the germination and shoot growth of Maize and Barley it was reported that as the concentration of root extract increases, there is a decreasing trend in germination and shoot growth. On germination, shoot length, root length, seed vigour, tolerance index, root length, shoot length, fresh and dry weight of bean seedlings are inhibited by the <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> leaf, stem and flower extracts [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The aqueous extracts of root and shoot of <italic>Parthenium</italic> in higher concentration reduced the germination percentage and growth of Glycine max (soyabean). The productivity of this crop is adversely threatened by the <italic>Parthenium</italic> weed invasion (Netsere et al., 2011). <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> is a weed of worldwide impact [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], it presents over 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Oceania [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

This is a close relative and one of the most important parents in the interspecific hybridization of sugarcane as shown in <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. It has adapted to live over a wide range of grassland climatic habitats: from oriental Asia to the southern region, in the warm-temperate areas of Africa and in Mediterranean regions. In the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands, a lowland ecoregion at the base of the Himalaya range in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, this grass quickly colonises in the exposed silt plains created each year by the retreating monsoon floods, forming almost pure stands on the lowest portions of the floodplain. The grasslands exhibited by <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic> are an important habitat for the Indian rhinoceros <italic>(Rhinoceros unicornis)</italic>. The productivity of many crop species has been reported to be reduced due to invasion of this species. Apart from that this is a host for many of the pests which spreads to the adjacent cropland. <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> is a serious weed of cotton, pearl millet, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, forage crops, horticultural gardens and plantation crops such as tea and coffee in tropical and subtropical climates. In India, germination and emergence occurs in June/July after the first showers of the rainy season; adult plants bear flowers by the end of the rainy season, as shown in <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Reproductive potential about this plant is very less known. Mostly it is by means of rhizomes vegetative propagated and also produces large number of seeds. Seed dispersal to a large extent drives the spread of the species. Reforestation has been suggested as a strategy to control <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic>, an invasive grass that impedes regeneration in disturbed areas of the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW). <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic> distubes forest ecosystem by promoting fire and the natural regeneration is inhibited by this vegetation [<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Height and competition of <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> correlated negatively with intensity of mechanical cleanings and herbicide application.

These are: cultural, mechanical, biological, Chemical etc. Different cultural practices mulching, using transplants, tillage, drip irrigation, rapid cleanup after harvest etc. reduces weed numbers but cannot eliminate weed completely. Stale seedbed techniques are to prepare soil for planting and bring weed seeds to the surface, allow weeds to germinate and kills weeds with light tillage. But after this method also there will be residual amount of weed biomass. Cover crops may reduce weed emergence by 75% &#x02212;90% but still there is remnant of weeds. Weeds tend to infest crops having the similar life cycle. Changing cultural practices related to cultivation process, use of fertilizers, application of herbicide may lead to management of weed but to eradicate weeds completely is beyond possible. Physical and mechanical practices also used like mourning, cultivation, soil solarization, Hand weeding, Flaming. But these processes have cost-benefit impact. There are various adverse effects of all these processes. Cultivation is a practice better for perennial and biennial control than annual weed control. Some of the processes require month long treatment processes. The different drawbacks of cultivation processes are it exposes the bare ground, leads to soil compaction, cost expensive equipment&#x02019;s are required, cannot be processed in wet condition. Flaming is another process to knock down weed seedlings prior to planting and just before crop germination flaming used to kill weed seedlings. But all of these processes lead to the generation of weed biomass which is ultimately going to the waste stream and there is no proper method for the disposal of these weeds. Biological control is also practiced in various time. California's most pervasive weed yellow star thistle have been reported to be controlled by six species of overseas insects [<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As conventional weed management practices are unsuccessful for the weed lythrum salicaria, a biological control by root boring weevil <italic>Hylobius transversovittatus</italic> (highly host specific to the target weed have been approved in 1992 [<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Though biological control attempts have been made on <italic>L.camara</italic> longer than on any other weed, the plant is still not under adequate control. As it is a hybrid species consisting of many phenotypes, originating from two or more species of <italic>Lantana</italic> in tropical America, and that it grows in a wide range of climatic areas that influences the biocontrol of this plant [<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. But biocontrol of weed can cause serious problem due to attack by agent on non-target plant species and therefore it is essential to protect the non-target species. Host specificity is required before approving release of agents. There is various evidence in history of unforeseen interaction of agent with non-target plants. The chemicals methods used to kill weeds using various weedicides have various environmental consequences. The soil fertility is lost due to repeated application of chemicals and also using these chemicals in agricultural fields, the trances of these chemicals enters the food chain. The results of hand weeding are significantly better but as it is time consuming and laborious to human, hence it cannot be recommended at large scale [<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The application of herbicides is common today and is used in wide scale. But concern is directed towards its impact on non-target organisms as well as an ultimate fate of these chemicals on our environment. Even finding small traces of these elements on our environment is a major threat. The residual of these elements in entire ecosystem leads to unsustainable condition specially the aquatic system where the drainage flows from areas treated with herbicides. The prevention of water contamination is the utmost concern for human kind and for the whole ecosystem.
