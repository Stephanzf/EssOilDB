Herein, we probed the relationships between load-carrying capacity and crystal structure. The results showed that increasing the sliding resistance of interlayers using corrugated layers increased the load-carrying capacity of layered solid lubricants. This finding expands on the traditional lubrication mechanism of layered materials. Following the rules, rapid selection of layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates (K-LMP and K-LCP) as effective solid lubricants was achieved using crystallographic data and strict filtering criteria. In order to prepare materials suitable for lubrication, the synthesis of K-LMP and K-LCP was optimised. These materials could be utilised in the food, textile or marine machinery industries in the future. The developed method could successfully guide the synthesis of application-oriented materials.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21506145</award-id><award-id>21506145</award-id><award-id>21506145</award-id><award-id>51372162</award-id><award-id>21436008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiaosheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Niu</surname><given-names>Wenxing</given-names></name><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>Yingjing</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Hong</given-names></name><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Jinxiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With the rapid development of human civilisation, energy consumption is constantly increasing. To meet this growing need, major strategies include increasing the effective use of fossil fuels, developing new alternative energies, and reducing consumption of conventional energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It has been reported that one third of the world&#x02019;s energy resource consumption is wasted through friction and wear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and the effective use of lubricants offers a potential route to increasing energy use efficiency.</p><p id="Par3">Solid lubricants are essential for heavy impact/load operations since they provide wear protection and enhance load-carrying performance. Molybdenum disulfide (hereafter referred to as MoS<sub>2</sub>) is the predominant material used as a solid lubricant due to its lamellar crystalline structure with weak van der Waals-type bonds between planes. This substance can prevent metal on metal contact under high-load conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, molybdenum is a scarce resource that represents a source of heavy metal pollution, and the lubricating ability of MoS<sub>2</sub> deteriorates over time due to oxidation to MoO<sub>3</sub>. Thus, it is important to develop other layered materials as effective and environmentally friendly solid lubricants.</p><p id="Par4">Previous research in this area has mainly focused on magnesium silicate hydroxide, layered double hydroxides, layered disodium silicates, layered zirconium phosphates, and some others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Among these, magnesium silicate hydroxide and layered double hydroxides possess good friction-reduction and anti-wear properties, but fail to improve the load-carrying capacity of lubrication oil and grease. Layered disodium silicates and layered zirconium phosphates exhibit good anti-wear, friction-reduction and load-carrying performance. The tribological properties of these layered materials have been evaluated under different test conditions, but the relationships between crystal structures and tribological properties remain poorly understood.</p><p id="Par5">In the present work, the tribological properties of the above-mentioned layered materials were investigated under identical test conditions, and the relationships between crystal structures and tribological properties were analysed based on the experimental data. We found that layered disodium silicate and layered zirconium phosphate possess better tribological properties than magnesium silicate hydroxide and layered double hydroxides, especially under higher load. The lubricating action is not only due to weak van der Waals-type bonds between planes, but also the corrugated layer, which generates slide resistance and acts as a buffer that facilitates a higher load-carrying capacity.</p><p id="Par6">Guided by these finding, we selected environmentally friendly layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates with corrugated layers using the periodic table and the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Synthesis conditions were established by varying the magnesium/calcium source, the molar ratio of raw materials, and the reaction temperature. A four-ball tester was employed to evaluate the tribological properties of biodegradable coconut oil calcium-based grease using the synthesised layered phosphates as solid lubricants. The results revealed that the layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates significantly increase the load-carrying capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Probing the relationships between load-carrying capacity and crystal structure</title><p id="Par7">We tested MoS<sub>2</sub>, graphite, magnesium silicate hydroxide (Mg<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>8</sub>; hereafter referred to as MgSH), magnesium aluminium layered double hydroxides ([Mg<sub>0.66</sub>Al<sub>0.33</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>](Cl)<sub>0.33</sub>&#x02219;nH<sub>2</sub>O; hereafter referred to as MgAl-LDH), layered zirconium phosphate (&#x003b1;-Zr(HPO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x02219;H<sub>2</sub>O; hereafter referred to as &#x003b1;-ZrP) and layered disodium silicate (&#x003b2;-Na<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; hereafter referred to as &#x003b2;-LDS) as inorganic layered solid lubricants. We then evaluate their friction and wear performance as additives in PAO8 lithium-based grease (hereafter referred to as lithium-based grease) under identical test conditions using a four-ball tester, which is commonly employed in friction tests. To investigate the lubricating properties of the six layered materials as lubricant additives, they were dispersed in pure lithium grease as described in the Methods section. The maximum non-seizure load (<italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value) of the additives were determined to represent the load-carrying performance. The anti-wear (WSD value, the wear scar diameter) and friction-reducing (COF value, the coefficient of friction) properties were also studied under different applied loads and temperatures.</p><p id="Par8"><italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> values as a function of temperature are displayed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. All additives proved capable of improving the <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value of pure lithium grease, and 5.0 wt.% &#x003b2;-LDS and 5.0 wt.% &#x003b1;-ZrP performed better than the other four additives at increasing the load-carrying capacity of base grease at different temperatures (25, 75 and 120&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). Since the additive amounts rang from 1.0 wt.%, 3.0 wt.% and 7.0 wt.% at different temperatures (25, 75 and 120&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), the <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> values tended to be similar to the amount at 5.0 wt.% (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). WSD values as a function of load at 75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C are plotted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. The highest load with no seizure was recorded with &#x003b2;-LDS and &#x003b1;-ZrP at 686&#x02009;N, and the second highest was with MgSH (490&#x02009;N), whereas only 392&#x02009;N was recorded for MoS<sub>2</sub>, graphite, MgAl-LDH and pure lithium grease. Under the highest applied load, WSD values for &#x003b2;-LDS and &#x003b1;-ZrP were 0.57 and 0.46&#x02009;mm, respectively, lower than other materials under their maximum applied load. This trend held true on temperatures between 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 120&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The corresponding worn surfaces of &#x003b2;-LDS and &#x003b1;-ZrP, assessed using a 3D optical profiler, were narrower and shallower than those of the other additives under their maximum applied load (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). These results showed that &#x003b2;-LDS and &#x003b1;-ZrP have better anti-wear properties under a higher applied load. From the dynamic friction curves in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, the friction coefficient of &#x003b2;-LDS and &#x003b1;-ZrP were 0.057 and 0.067, respectively, and remained steady throughout the maximum applied load tests (686&#x02009;N). The friction coefficients for MgSH, MoS<sub>2</sub>, MgAl-LDH and graphite were 0.112, 0.071, 0.094 and 0.076, respectively, under the applied load (392&#x02009;N).

As a result, the lubricity of the layered materials is due to planes of atoms sliding easily over one another. To better understand why &#x003b2;-LDS and &#x003b1;-ZrP possess good tribological properties, we obtained crystal structure data, <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> values, and maximum applied loads for the six layered materials (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The crystal structure data revealed that graphite has a monolayer carbon atom layer in which the atoms lie in almost truly planar basal planes. Meanwhile, the atom layers of the other five materials are arranged in multilayers. Atoms in the outer layer board of MoS<sub>2</sub>, MgSH and MgAl-LDH are mostly on the same plane, while the layer boards of &#x003b2;-LDS and &#x003b1;-ZrP are crumpled up. According to the <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> data under short (10&#x02009;s) test conditions, the maximum non-seizure loads for &#x003b2;-LDS, &#x003b1;-ZrP, MoS<sub>2</sub>, MgSH, MgAl-LDH and graphite were 1568, 1235, 617, 617, 490 and 441&#x02009;N, respectively. Meanwhile, under longer (3600&#x02009;s) friction-wear test conditions, the maximum applied loads for &#x003b2;-LDS, &#x003b1;-ZrP, MoS<sub>2</sub>, MgSH, MgAl-LDH and graphite were 686, 686, 490, 392, 392 and 392&#x02009;N, respectively. From the above results, layered materials with multilayer atom plates appear to support higher carrying loads than graphite with its monolayer carbon atom layer. &#x003b2;-LDS and &#x003b1;-ZrP have a corrugated layer, and displayed the best load-carrying capacity and had better anti-wear properties, especially under a higher applied load. When subjected to an impact force, the corrugated layer may induce slide resistance and provide a buffer to maintain a higher load-carrying capacity. Therefore, materials with a corrugated layer may perform better at improving the load-carrying capacity. Based on this assumption, an investigation was launched to rapidly select environmentally friendly layered phosphates as solid lubricants using crystallographic data.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Summary of crystal structure data and load-carrying mechanisms for some typical layered materials.

Thus environmentally friendly layered phosphates are in demand as solid lubricants. According to the periodic table, alkali metals sodium and potassium, and alkaline earth metals magnesium and calcium are environmentally friendly and abundant resources. Sodium and potassium phosphates are water soluble, so their crystal structures may be unstable in damp environments. However, magnesium and calcium phosphates are not only green, plentiful and water-insoluble; they also perform important physiological roles, and are safe for use in foods, medicines and cosmetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, layered magnesium and calcium phosphates with corrugated layers were tested in the present work.

Identifying effective, environmentally friendly layered materials that meet the demands of solid lubricants is therefore of great importance. Herein, we compared the load-carrying capacity of various typical layered lubricant materials (&#x003b2;-LDS, &#x003b1;-ZrP, MgSH, MgAl-LDH, MoS<sub>2</sub> and graphite) under identical test conditions, and probed the relationships between the load-carrying capacity and crystal structure. We found that layered materials with a corrugated layer performed better in terms of load-carrying capacity. The general view is that the planes of layered materials slide easily over one another, providing resistance to shearing forces and contributing to lubrication. In the present work, we found that increasing the sliding resistance of interlayers using corrugated layers could increase the load-carrying capacity of layered solid lubricants. This finding expands on the traditional lubrication mechanism of layered materials.</p><p id="Par18">In order to identify effective layered solid lubricants, we assessed layered phosphates using crystallographic data, and selected only materials with a corrugated layer that were water-insoluble, environmentally friendly, and available as an abundant resource. Following these rules, two representative layered potassium magnesium and calcium phosphates (K-LMP and K-LCP) were selected from more than 17 layered magnesium and calcium phosphates identified in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).</p><p id="Par19">In order to prepare materials suitable for lubrication, conditions for synthesising K-LMP and K-LCP were optimised. Regular flake particles with an average particle size of ~2.0 &#x003bc;m were obtained by altering the magnesium/calcium source, the molar ratio of raw materials, and the reaction temperature. The low solubility and high alkalinity of magnesium/calcium hydroxide may play a key role in particle size control.</p><p id="Par20">K-LMP and K-LCP improving the load-carrying capacity, anti-wear and friction-reducing properties of both lithium- and calcium-based grease. Interestingly, a green lubricating system including biodegradable coconut oil, an environmentally friendly calcium thickener, and layered magnesium/calcium phosphates has a better lubricating ability. This suggests layered magnesium and calcium phosphates could be utilised in specific application areas such as the food, textile or marine machinery industries in the future.</p><p id="Par21">In summary, rapid selection of effective layered solid lubricants was achieved using crystallographic data and strict filtering criteria. The established method could successfully guide the synthesis of application-oriented materials in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par22">The following chemicals were used: amorphous sodium silicate (SiO<sub>2</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>O mol ratio 1.9&#x02013;2.3 in the presence of 10&#x02013;25 wt.% water, Shandong Shengtong Group Share Co,.
