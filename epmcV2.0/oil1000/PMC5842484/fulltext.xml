Sucrose preference and forced swim tests were adopted to examine the antidepressant effect. Control (CON), OEO, CUS, and CUS + OEO groups were used. The OEO and CUS + OEO groups received OEO (0.2 mL/kg, i.p.), CON and CUS received saline (0.2 mL/kg, i.p.), and the positive drug groups of CUS rats received fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (3 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days. The expression of TLR 2/4 was determined using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction with the SYBR green reporter dye. The compositions of the OEO were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The main constituents were thymol (20.72%), gamma-terpinene (8.83%), borneol (8.72%), cymene (6.83%), carvacrol (6.274%), alfa-terpinene (5.26%), and sabinene (4.92%). Administration of OEO significantly alleviated the depressive symptoms of CUS. A higher level of TLR2/4 mRNA was seen in the brain of CUS group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The CUS-induced increases in the TLR2/4 levels were not reversed by OEO. According to the present study OEO may have the antidepressant-like activity but have no effect on the stress-induced TLR-2/4 upregulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic unpredictable stress</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd><italic>Origanum vulgare L.</italic></kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptor 2</kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptor 4</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>There are a great number of unexpected environmental, social, or pathological stimuli that happen during life and that can trigger stress. Being exposed to external stressors is recognized to increase the risk of psychiatric disorders such as depression, high susceptibility to infections, cancer development, and immune dysfunctions especially due to the higher levels of glucocorticoids (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). There is growing evidence in recent years indicating that exposure to certain psychological experiences, including stress-induced diseases, is closely connected with variations in immune parameters. In some cases, it has been noticed that both depression and chronic stressors have had significant connections with reduced adaptive/acquired immunity and inflammation; however, only recent studies have pointed out that after being exposed to stress or during certain episodes of depression, an innate inflammatory/immune response is strongly activated (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The study by Munhoz, <italic>et al</italic>., for instance, reveals that chronic unpredictable stress potentiated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#x003ba;B) activation and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Among the essential signaling components of the mammalian host defense system are Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Recently, a number of research works have shown interest in TLRs and their potential roles in neuropathology (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The finding that neurons, astrocytes and resident microglia express TLRs, just like immune cells (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), has challenged the way neuroscience explains the role of the brain&#x02019;s immune system (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In an experimental model of depression in rodents, the expression of mRNA levels for Tolllike receptor 4 (TLR-4) in the brain cortex overweighed those in a normal brain (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Currently, there is a growing interest in the use of medicinal plants as a group of natural substances that could be a good source for managing of disorders. Considerable attention has been invested in the positive effects of natural medication on alleviating stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depressive disorders (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The Lamiaceae family is among the largest and most distinctive families of flowering plants. It has about 220 genera and almost 4000 species worldwide (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Labiatae are best known for the essential oils of many family members. <italic>Origanum vulgare L.</italic> &#x0201c;Oregano&#x0201d; as an aromatic plant is rich in phenolic compounds with therapeutic actions widely distributed throughout Asia, including Iran. Oregano is the herb widely used in cooking and natural medicine. It has applied for the treatment of respiratory and hypoglycemic diseases and microorganisms inhibition (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Previous studies have shown that oregano oil contains thymol, &#x003b3;-terpinene, carvacrol, cis-terpinene, p-cymene, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, and sabinene hydrate as the main components (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It has been reported that thymol exhibit significant anti-anxiety activity in rat (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, in the plus maze test, anxiolytic effects are presented by carvacrol (5-isopropyl-2-methylphenol) (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which is one of the major components of the essential oil of oregano (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>The identification of active components such as thymol and carvacrol from oregano that have been shown to induce anti-anxiety effects and other bioactive polyphenols, prompted us to assess the antidepressant potential of oregano essential oil. To the best of our knowledge, the antidepressant effects of oregano essential oil (OEO) have not been fully investigated. In this present study, the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model was used to further elucidate the antidepressant-like effects of oregano. In the (CUS) model (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), animals are subjected to a variety of unpredictable stressors continuously leading to neurochemical and behavioral changes that are similar to those found in people with depression. Furthermore, since the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are critical for stress (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the corresponding changes in TLR2/4 gene expression in these important brain areas were examined along with the behavioral evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Wistar rats with an average weight of 190-240 g were obtained from the animal house of the University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran and animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle condition with free access to food and water.

Here, we examined the depressive like behavior using the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) in rat CUS model. Before the start of the CUS protocol the animals were tested with the FST and SPT to determine the animals&#x02019; depressive state (baseline, 1 day). In the period of CUS exposure (10 days) depressive like behavior was evaluated using SPT and FST as well. At the end of treatments (25 days), anti-depressive effects of different drugs were evaluated using SPT and FST.

We used this protocol because it was used as an animal model to induce anxiety. This animal model of stress consists of chronic exposure to variable unpredictable stressors, none of which is sufficient alone to induce long-lasting effects. Vary stressors were used and applied in a different sequence each week to avoid any habituation. Each animal received two stresses per day individually for a period of 24 days. After each stressor, animals were kept in a recovery room for 1 h, following which they were placed in clean cages with fresh bedding and returned to the housing facility. Control rats were individually housed for the same period of time, and were handled daily for 1 min in the housing room, but were not stressed.</p><p>The animals in stress groups were exposed to the CUS protocol as follows: Day 1, 15 min forced swim (20 &#x000b0;C), tail pinch; day 2, 12 h cage tilting (45 &#x000b0;C), 1 h cage rotation; day 3, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 1 h cold room (4 &#x000b0;C); day 4, 12 h wet bedding, crowded cage; day 5, 24 h food deprivation, 1 h restraint; day 6, 12 h cage tilting (45 &#x000b0;C), crowded cage; day 7, 24 h water deprivation, 1 h cold room isolation; day 8, reversal of the light/dark cycle, tail pinch; day 9, cold room (4 &#x000b0;C), 1h cage rotation; day 10, 24 h water and food deprivation, 12 h cage tilting (45&#x000b0;C); day 11, 15 min forced swim (20 &#x000b0;C), 1 h restraint; day 12, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 24 h food deprivation; day 13, tail pinch, cold room (4 &#x000b0;C); day 14, 24 h water deprivation, 1 h restraint; day 15, 12 h wet bedding, 12 h cage tilting (45 &#x000b0;C); day 16, 1 h cage rotation, reversal of the light/dark cycle; day 17, 1 h restraint, crowded cage; day 18, 12 h wet bedding, tail pinch; day 19, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 12 h cage tilting (45 &#x000b0;C); day 20, 15 min forced swim (20 &#x000b0;C), 24 h water deprivation; day 21, 1 h cage rotation, crowded cage; day 22, 24 h food deprivation, tail pinch; day 23, 1 h restraint, 12 h wet bedding; day 24, 24 h water and food deprivation, crowded cage.

The CUS animal model has good validity and seems to represent unpredictable pressure faced by people every day. Previous studies have demonstrated that exposing rodents to unpredictable stress procedures that use different stressors, 1-2 times a day for 7-54 days leads to a behavioral model of long-term human stress exposure (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The current study found that after exposure to 10 days of unpredictable stress, the animals develop variety of symptoms similar to symptoms of human suffering from depression. According to these data, CUS induced depression like behavior as it is evident from increased immobility time in the FST and significant drop of sucrose preference and weight loss. The FST and SPT have widely been utilized to assess depression-like behavior (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Based on our results, 24 days chronic unpredictable stress exposure up regulates TLR-2 and TLR-4 mRNA expression levels both at the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the male rats. Although there is some positive correlation between mRNA and protein expression, a combination of genomic and proteomic experiments leads to definite results. There is increasing attention to TLRS due to their potential role in neuropsychiatric disease.</p><p>The possibility that TLR is also involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders is supported by the results of recent studies (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The findings of the present study support evidence of the important role of TLR4 in stress-induced depression. To our knowledge, direct evaluation of TLR-expression changes have been done by a few studies in the context of depression. In animal studies, lack of TLR4 is associated with the reduction of alcohol withdrawal-related anxiety behaviors (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, further investigations are still needed, to provide more evidence on the association between TLR gene expression and chronic stress induced disorders. Recently several studies have focused trying to link TLR with neuropathology. McKernan, <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that there are specific alterations in TLR2 and TLR4 activation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In a recent report by Wu, <italic>et al</italic>., it was suggested that anxiety has a significant association with peripheral TLR4 mRNA expression (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Preclinical studies also indicate that TLR4 expression has witnessed a rise in the prefrontal cortex in a stress-based model of depression (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Besides alterations in the central nervous system expression, changed peripheral expression of TLRs appears to be closely connected with depression and is perhaps responsible for the heightened inflammatory state (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, the findings of our study suggest that the OEO possesses an antidepressant-like activity and reversed behavioral alterations observed in the CUS model. A previous study has demonstrated that the oregano extract inhibits the reuptake and degradation of the monoamine neuro-transmitters in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In the present study, we attempted to find out whether OEO can reduce the stress-induced expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In spite of the antidepressant-like activity, stress-induced TLR- 2/4 upregulation is not prevented by the chronic OEO treatments. We did not find any remarkable effect of oregano on the stress up regulated TLR2/4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of oregano on the chronic stress induced TLR gene expression in the nervous system. However, further investigations needed to provide more evidence on the mechanism of OEO effect on stress induced depressive like behavior and neuroinflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, our study shows that the exposure of rats to chronic unpredictable stress results in the development of depressive-like behavior and high expression of TLR2/4 mRNA levels in the brain. In spite of the antidepressant-like activity, stress-induced TLR-2/4 upregulation is not prevented by the OEO treatments. It seems that further research is required to clarify the effect of OEO on neuroinflammations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors sincerely thank Dr. Seyed
