    "Cold plasma is known as a novel nonthermal processing method for decontamination of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs); however, there are little research studies about its effects on active ingredients of these plants. The aim of this research was to investigate the influence of low-pressure cold plasma (LPCP) treatments (1, 3, and 5Â min) on the essential oil (EO) content and composition of lemon verbena leaves. The EO content was determined using hydro-distillation, and the composition of the extracted EOs was quantified using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. The results showed that by increasing the LPCP treatment duration, the EO content was reduced from 1.2 to 0.9 (% v/w). The highest content of monoterpene hydrocarbons (e.g., limonene) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (e.g., spathulenol and globulol) was also observed in LPCP-treated ones, whereas the oxygenated monoterpenes (e.g., citral) content of control was measurably higher than those treated with LCPC."
