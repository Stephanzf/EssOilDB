Currently, CG is widely used in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China, as well as in the Caucasus [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-25-3591" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CG is a Chinese Uygur medicinal herb with a bitter taste and has the functions of clearing the liver and gallbladder, improving digestion, and acts as a diuretic. CG has been reported to be used to treat jaundice, stomach ache, to treat obesity, edema, hepatitis, nephritis, enteritis, tracheitis, and other diseases [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-25-3591" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the chemical constituents of CG and its clinical toxicological and pharmacological effects have been studied. It has been shown that CG has protective effects on liver fibrosis, but the mechanism of its pharmacological effects remains unknown.
