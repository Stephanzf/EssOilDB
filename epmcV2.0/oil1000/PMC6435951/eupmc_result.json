    "In recent years, growing attention has been given to traditional medicine. In traditional medicine a large number of plants have been used to cure neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other memory related disorders. Crocus sativus (C. sativus), Nigella sativa (N. sativa), Coriandrum sativum (C. sativum), Ferula assafoetida (F. assafoetida), Thymus vulgaris (T. vulgaris), Zataria multiflora (Z. multiflora) and Curcuma longa (C. longa) were used traditionally for dietary, food additive, spice and various medicinal purposes. The Major components of these herbs are carotenoids, monoterpenes and poly phenol compounds which enhanced the neural functions. These medicinal plants increased anti-oxidant, decreased oxidant levels and inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in the neural system. Furthermore, neuroprotective of plants occur via reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and total nitrite generation. Therefore, the effects of the above mentioned medicinal and their active constituents improved neurodegenerative diseases which indicate their therapeutic potential in disorders associated with neuro-inflammation and neurotransmitter deficiency such as AD and depression."
