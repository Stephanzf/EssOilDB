    "An alternating synergetic ultrasound/microwave method was applied to the simultaneous extraction of essential oils and polysaccharides with deep eutectic solvent (DES) from Schisandra chinensis. Under the optimal conditions, extract in the selected choline chloride-ethylene glycol 1:3 solvent yielded 12.2 mL/kg and 8.56 g/100g of essential oils and polysaccharides, respectively. The free radical scavenging and immunological activities of the polysaccharides and the antioxidant activity of the essential oils have also been investigated. The lymphocyte proliferation capacity was substantially improved by adding concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharides to polysaccharides (0.20 mg/mL). The IC50 values of the essential oils for scavenging DPPH obtained by hydro-distillation and DES ultrasound/microwave-assisted hydro-distillation (DES UMHD) were 52.34 µg/mL and 29.82 µg/mL, respectively. The essential oil obtained by DES UMHD had the highest reducing power (856.05 (TE)/g) at 150 g/mL and had the strongest inhibitory capacity (SC% = 18.12%). S. chinensis has the potential to be developed as a natural antioxidant."
