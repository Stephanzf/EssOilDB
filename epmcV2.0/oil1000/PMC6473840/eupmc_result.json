    "Fertilizer is very important for increasing food yield, but the extensive use of fertilizer will cause environmental pollution. To enhance the effectiveness of fertilizer, we developed the double organic silicone-modified recycled-oil-based polyurethane as a coating material to prepare degradable polymer coating urea for constant fertilizer release. The moisture, heat resistance, and sustained release properties of polyurethane coating materials were investigated by modification with hydroxyl-terminated polydimethyl silicone (HTPMS) and γ-Aminopropyl triethoxy silane (KH550). The content and distribution of the siloxane groups were effectively controlled by adjusting the content ratio of two kinds of organosilicon. Meanwhile, the organic⁻inorganic hybrid structure was further controlled to form three-dimensional networks with a uniform distribution and a small scale. The moisture and heat resistance of polyurethane were thus improved, resulting in reduced porosity and an excellent sustained release performance. Observably, the best sustained release property of modified polyurethane coated urea was obtained when the ratio of KH550 to HTPMS is 0.3:0.7."
