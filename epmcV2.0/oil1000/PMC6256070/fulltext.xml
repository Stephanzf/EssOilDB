A transcriptome approach was used to determine the unique terpene biosynthesis pathway and to explore the different regulatory mechanisms responsible for the variation of terpene content among individuals. Analysis of <italic>de novo-</italic>assembled contigs revealed a complete set of genes for terpene biosynthesis. A total of 23,261 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) were discovered between high and low oil-yielding plants. DEG enrichment analysis suggested that the terpene biosynthesis process and the plant hormone signal transduction pathway may exert a major role in determining terpene variation in <italic>S. glabra</italic>. The expression patterns of candidate genes were further verified by quantitative RT-PCR experiments. Key genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis pathway were predominantly expressed in phloem and root tissues. Phylogenetic analysis and subcellular localization implied that <italic>S. glabra</italic> terpene synthases may evolve from a common ancestor. Furthermore, two sesquiterpene synthase genes, <italic>SgSTPS1</italic> and <italic>SgSTPS2</italic>, were functionally characterized. SgSTPS1 mainly generated &#x003b2;-caryophyllene from farnesyl pyrophosphate. SgSTPS2 is a versatile enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 12 sequiterpenes from farnesyl pyrophosphate and synthesis of three monoterpenes using geranyl pyrophosphate. Together, these results provide large reservoir for elucidating the molecular mechanism of terpene biosynthesis and for exploring the ecological function of sesquiterpenes in <italic>S. glabra</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd><italic>Sindora glabra</italic></kwd><kwd>oleoresin</kwd><kwd>terpene biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>terpene synthase</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="62"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="10490"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The angiosperm Caesalpinioideae subfamily includes the important genera <italic>Copaifera</italic> Linn., <italic>Hymenaea</italic> Linn., and <italic>Sindora</italic> Miq., which are traditionally referred to as &#x0201c;diesel trees&#x0201d; by local people (Langenheim, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). These diesel trees produce a sesquiterpene-rich oleoresin that is routinely collected when the plant trunk is drilled into and tapped.Oleoresin has been widely utilized in pharmaceuticals, fuel, essential oils and food (Peltier et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gershenzon and Dudareva, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Harvey et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, the focus of oleoresin production research in plants has been predominantly limited to the genus <italic>Copaifera</italic>, which is distributed in tropical America and Africa (Souza Barbosa et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Amorim et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The genus <italic>Sindora</italic>, naturally distributed in the tropical forests of Asia and Africa, contains the species <italic>Sindora glabra</italic>, which is indigenous to Hainan Island, China. The <italic>S. glabra</italic> tree exudes yellowish oleoresin or an amber liquid oil when wounded that has been conventionally used as kerosene. Due to its endangered state this species has been included in the second-class national protection plants of China. Studies have shown that the annual oleoresin yield of <italic>S. glabra</italic> varies from 0.01 to 3.00 L among different individuals and the major components of the resin oil are sesquiterpenes (about 85%) and abietic acid (about 13%) (Yang et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), which is a unique feature of <italic>S. glabra</italic> oleoresin. Variation in the oil composition is present across the natural distribution range of <italic>S. glabra</italic>.</p><p>Terpenes are one of the largest and most diverse class of plant metabolites and serve essential functions in plant growth, development, and defense. Moreover, many terpenes of specialized metabolites, such as artemisinin from <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> and paclitaxel from <italic>Taxus baccata</italic>, have high medical value (Klayman, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Sandler et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, the amount and composition of terpenes differ greatly among plant species and tissues. The gymnosperm <italic>Pinus</italic> stores oleoresin in specialized resin canals and produces higher yields in spring (0.65 kg) and summer (0.55 kg) compared to autumn and winter (Lombardero et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Rodrigues and Fett-Neto, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Moreover, gymnosperm oleoresin is almost universally composed of mono- and di-terpenes. Paclitaxel are mainly extracted from tree bark, while tanshinone from <italic>Saliva miltiorrhiza</italic> is extracted from roots (Ge and Wu, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanisms of terpene biosynthesis have been thoroughly studied (Tholl, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Degenhardt et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Terpenes are polymers of isoprene and are derived from the five carbon units of isopentyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are generated from the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway or the cytoplasmic mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Condensation of IPP and DMAPP by prenyltransferase contribute to the three linear intermediates, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which are then catalyzed by terpene synthases (TPSs) to form monoterpenes (C<sub>10</sub>), sesquiterpenes (C<sub>15</sub>), and diterpenes (C<sub>20</sub>) (Lichtenthaler, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Generally, the MEP pathway generates monoterpenes and diterpenes, whereas the MVA pathway produces sesquiterpenes and triterpenes. There is also some cross-talk between these two pathways, for example, the non-MVA pathway synthesizes both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in roots and leaves of <italic>Daucus carota</italic> (Hampel et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Products of various TPSs are further subject to structural modification through oxidation, reduction, isomerization, hydration, and conjugation to give rise to the chemical diversity of terpenes (McGarvey and Croteau, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Many TPSs can utilize the same substrate to produce multiple products and the variation of even a single amino acid mutation in conserved domains of TPSs can alter product profiles (Li J. X. et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Plant genomes typically contain families of many TPSs with similar sequences but that are functionally diverse, with gene numbers ranging from ~20 to 150 (Chen et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Variation in the genome and expression levels of TPSs may explain some of the variation in terpenes present in natural <italic>S. glabra</italic> populations. Substantial progress has been achieved in the discovery and elucidation of TPSs involved in terpene biosynthesis in tree species, including the gymnosperms <italic>Abies grandis, Picea abies</italic>, and <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, and the angiosperms <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia, Santalum spicatum</italic>, and <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> (Warren et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bustos-Segura et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Factors affecting terpene biosynthesis are quite complex and could include the plant developmental stage, biotic factors, such as insects and pathogens, and abiotic factors, such as light, temperature, and humidity. In <italic>Picea</italic> spp., stem resin accumulates constitutively in the cortex, while it appears within the developing xylem after mechanical wounding, insect feeding, or fungal elicitation (Martin et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Some transcription factors, including the MYB, ERF, YABBY, and NAC families, have been found to regulate the biosynthesis of terpene secondary metabolites (Nieuwenhuizen et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Mat&#x000ed;as-Hern&#x000e1;ndez et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Plant signaling molecules, especially jasmonic acid (JA), have great potential to elicit the production of terpenes in gymnosperms, herbs and crops (Martin et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kim et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ghasemzadeh et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Herbivore-induced diterpene resin in conifer trees were discovered to serve important defense functions (Keeling and Bohlmann, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Hall et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In <italic>Sitka spruce</italic>, traumatic resin and terpene synthase transcripts were induced following attack by white pine weevils, and the defense response was more complex than that associated with methyl jasmonate (Miller et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Elucidation of terpene biosynthesis in <italic>S. glabra</italic> provides a basis to understand oil composition and variability. With a deeper understanding of the genetic mechanism of metabolic pathways in this species, we could improve our understanding of the developmental and physiological conditions that are responsible for the production of the resin oil. This in turn may support breeding efforts toward tree improvement for oil yield and quality in sustainable <italic>S. glabra</italic> plantations and can afford opportunities for biotechnological <italic>S. glabra</italic> oil production (Bustos-Segura et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Some important genes can be identified for enhanced production of a particular terpene in either microorganisms or other plant species. In this study, comprehensive <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome analysis of high and low oil-yielding <italic>S. glabra</italic> was carried out. Key genes related to terpene biosynthesis were mined, and the expression patterns were validated in experiments. The function of <italic>S. glabra</italic> sesquiterpene synthase was further characterized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>Plants were grown from seeds from eight natural populations of <italic>S. glabra</italic> distributed in Hainan Island in glasshouse with 16 h light photoperiods.

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by comparing high oil-yielding plants with low oil-yielding plants: pair H10 and L4, H10 and L6, H12 and L4, and H12 and L6, respectively. There were 9,797 unigenes up-regulated in H10 and H12, and 9,393 unigenes were predominantly expressed in L4 and L6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

In particular, there were 34 DEGs significantly enriched in terpene synthase activity, which implied positive roles of these DEGs in the regulation of terpene synthesis. When analyzing the down-regulated DEGs in H10 and H12, there were 803 DEGs enriched in signal transduction in the biological process, suggesting possible negative regulation of these DEGs in oil yield.</p><p>Furthermore, KEGG pathway enrichment of these DEGs resulted in the assignment of 121 metabolic pathways. The flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was significantly enriched in H10 and H12 predominantly expressed DEGs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In addition, there were 43 and 13 up-regulated DEGs enriched in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway, respectively, which were consistent with the GO enrichment results that terpene biosynthesis-related DEGs could increase the terpene content. In L4 and L6 predominantly expressed DEGs, five KEGG pathways were significantly enriched, among which the majority of DEGs were involved in the plant hormone signal transduction pathway, further implying the potential influence of plant signal transduction-related DEGs in the down-regulation of terpene yield.

Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation of IPP and DMPP to generate GPP, which is further utilized by farnesylpyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) for the synthesis of FPP that is subsequently catalyzed by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) for the production of GGPP. The transcriptional mining identified two unigenes for GPPS, six for FPPS, and three for GGPPS. The relatively higher expression of FPPS unigenes than those of GPPS and GGPPS is in agreement with sesquiterpenes being the predominant component of terpene oil in <italic>S. glabra</italic>.

After transcriptome assembly, the total number, N50 length and mean length of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcipts and unigenes of <italic>S. glabra</italic> were much higher than those recently reported in other non-model plants including <italic>Carya illinoinensis</italic> (Mo et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), <italic>Kandelia obovata</italic> (Hong et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), <italic>Kalopanax septemlobus</italic> (Han et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> (Ali et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> (Bustos-Segura et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), suggesting high accuracy and reliability of the sequencing data. Numerous annotated unigenes (61.9%) were found to be distributed in the Fabaceae family, which was reasonable since <italic>S. glabra</italic> belongs to the Caesalpinioideae subfamily that is included in the Fabaceae family. Both GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs in H10 and H12 compared to L4 and L6 revealed that the terpene biosynthesis process and the plant hormone signal transduction pathway may play roles in determining the terpene variation in <italic>S. glabra</italic>. However, even plants belonging to the same type (low- or high-producing type) exhibited enormous differences in gene expression profiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These DEGs between H10 and H12 or between L4 and L6 may be accountable for the difference in the ratio of different terpene compounds (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary origin of SgTPSs</title><p>Based on the reaction mechanism and products formed, plant TPSs can be classified as class I, class II, or class I/II enzymes. Class I TPSs contain the DDXXD and NSE/DTE motifs that coordinate with Mg<sup>2+</sup> on their C-terminus. Class II TPSs include the DXDD motif for protonation-initiated cyclization of the substrate. The bifunctional class I/II diTPS harbors both functional active sites (Chen et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In <italic>S. glabra</italic>, the sesquiterpene synthases, SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2, and the diterpene synthases, SgDTPS2, SgDTPS3, and SgDTPS4, contain the DDXXD and NSE/DTE motifs, suggesting that they are class I TPSs that require Mg<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor. The sequence annotation, homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that both SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 are sesquiterpene synthases. However, both SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 contain an additional EDXXD motif at the N-terminus, which in its active form contributes to class II diterpene synthase activity (Cao et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Bifunctional class I/II diterpene synthases are only known in non-vascular plants and gymnosperms. In angiosperms, all of the diterpene synthases that have been characterized to date are monofunctional, with loss of activity in one domain or the other. All of the sesquiterpene synthases are monofunctional, having retained only one active site. TPSs containing the EDXXD domain are members of the TPS-d, -c, -e, -f clades (Martin et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Furthermore, an additional RRX<sub>8</sub>W motif was also found at the N-terminus of the two SgSTPS genes, but it was not present in the four SgDTPS genes. The RRX<sub>8</sub>W motif is essential for cleavage of the transit peptide in mono- and di-terpene synthases (Chen et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Subcellular localization confirmed that the two SgSTPSs were localized in the cytosol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). <italic>S. glabra</italic> terpene synthase gene motifs may suggest the evolutionary origin of terpene synthase through domain loss or subfunctionalization from a common ancestor, which has been reported in <italic>Magnolia</italic> sesquiterpene synthase (Lee and Chappell, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and <italic>Copaifera</italic> sesquiterpene synthases (Joyce, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This hypothesis was further supported by the enzymatic activity of the two SgSTPSs. Although SgSTPS1 mainly catalyzed the formation of sesquiterpene caryophyllene when using FPP as substrate, there were trace amounts of linalool and geraniol produced at the retention times of 10.42 and 13.37 min, respectively, when using GPP as the substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S5</xref>). SgSTPS2 was confirmed to have bi-substrate capability that could catalyze both GPP and FPP to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). These results indicated that SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2 still retain partial MTPSs activity. Multi-substrate capability was found to be usual in MTPSs and STPSs (Pazouki and Niinemets, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, there was no monoterpene discovered in <italic>S. glabra</italic> oleoresin and no chloroplastic signal peptide could be detected in SgSTPS1 and SgSTPS2. As monoterpenes are usually produced in chloroplasts through the MEP pathway, these results indicate that <italic>S. glabra</italic> sesquiterpene synthases may evolve through the loss of the chloroplast signal peptide. Further functional and structural characterizations are needed to decipher the evolutionary shift from mono- and di-terpene-rich oleoresin in gymnosperms to sesquiterpene-abundant oleoresin in angiosperms.</p></sec><sec><title>Contribution of SgSTPSs to <italic>S. glabra</italic> oleoresin composition</title><p>It has been reported that the transcript abundance of TPS is positively correlated with the accumulation of terpene (Nieuwenhuizen et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bustos-Segura et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Yu et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In this study, the two identified SgSTPSs revealed higher expression in H10 compared to L4, suggesting the potential roles of the two genes in determining the terpene amount in <italic>S. glabra</italic>. In <italic>S. glabra</italic> oleoresin, the major components of sesquiterpenes are &#x003b1;-copaene (32.26%) and &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (16.33%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Yang et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Here, by a combination of transcriptome and experimental analyses, we identified that SgSTPS1 was mainly responsible for &#x003b2;-caryophyllene sesquiterpene production, while SgSTPS2 was accountable for &#x003b1;-copaene production. Nevertheless, SgSTPS2 is a versatile enzyme that can also produce other sesquiterpenes including ylangene, germacrene, elemene, cadinene, muurolene, and amorphene, all of which were present in <italic>S. glabra</italic> oleoresin except elemene, which may be a byproduct due to rearrangements of different sesquiterpenes (Agger et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Therefore, the two SgSTPS enzymatic products matched well with the chemical composition of oleoresin in the <italic>S. glabra</italic> stem. Furthermore, these results indicated that different sesquiterpene synthases have diversified functionally to produce specific kinds of products. Among the characterized plant &#x003b2;-caryophyllene synthases, SgSTPS1 exhibited the highest amino acid identity (46%) to GhTPS from <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> (AFQ23183) (Huang et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), 40% identity to AtTPS from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (AAO85539) (Huang et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and the lowest identity (35%) to ZmTPS from <italic>Zea mays</italic> (ABY79207) (K&#x000f6;llner et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), three of which catalyzed the formation of &#x003b2;-caryophyllene as the major product from FPP. In particular, the product amorphadiene that SgSTPS2 synthesizes from FPP is a precursor of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, which can be used for the production of artemisinic acid. The identified SgSTPS2 shared 42% similarity with amorpha-4,11-diene synthase from <italic>A. annua</italic> (ABM88787). Furthermore, &#x003b2;-caryophyllene and &#x003b1;-copaene in plant species were found to serve in defense against pathogens or herbivores, and the identified sesquiterpene synthases were involved in the defense response (Huang et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that SgSTPSs may be responsible for the defense response in <italic>S. glabra</italic>. Further research is needed to investigate the ecological functions of sesquiterpenes and corresponding SgSTPSs.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential regulatory network of terpene synthesis</title><p>TFs play a predominant role in regulating the expression of genes in various metabolic pathways. Identification of those TFs could be important for understanding the regulatory mechanism of terpene biosynthesis in <italic>S. glabra</italic>. Most of the identified TFs for regulating terpene metabolites belong to the WRKY family, including <italic>TcWRKY1</italic> from <italic>Taxus chinensis</italic> (Li S. et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), <italic>AaWRKY1</italic> from <italic>A. annua</italic> (Ma et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), <italic>GaWRKY1</italic> from <italic>Gossypium arboreum</italic> (Xu et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and <italic>HbWRKY1</italic> from <italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic> (Wang et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which activate the expression of genes encoding key enzymes involved in the metabolite pathway. Here, we suggest that <italic>SgWRKY</italic> may be a positive regulator in <italic>S. glabra</italic> terpene biosynthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), which is consistent with the role of WRKY in other plants based on previous research. However, the regulatory role and downstream target of <italic>SgWRKY</italic> in terpene biosynthesis need to be further explored and confirmed by functional analysis. More transcriptome and experimental data are needed to elucidate the metabolic regulatory network. How transcription factors are connected to the signaling pathway and how their action is integrated with other regulatory circuits await further investigation in <italic>S. glabra</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>NY designed the study and wrote the manuscript.
