    "Fish are rich in n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, thus they have a great nutritional value for human health. In this study, the adipogenic potential of fatty acids commonly found in fish oil (EPA and DHA) and vegetable oils (linoleic (LA) and alpha-linolenic (ALA) acids), was evaluated in bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from gilthead sea bream. At a morphological level, cells adopted a round shape upon all treatments, losing their fibroblastic form and increasing lipid accumulation, especially in the presence of the n-6 PUFA, LA. The mRNA levels of the key transcription factor of osteogenesis, runx2 significantly diminished and those of relevant osteogenic genes remained stable after incubation with all fatty acids, suggesting that the osteogenic process might be compromised. On the other hand, transcript levels of the main adipogenesis-inducer factor, pparg increased in response to EPA. Nevertheless, the specific PPARγ antagonist T0070907 appeared to suppress the effects being caused by EPA over adipogenesis. Moreover, LA, ALA and their combinations, significantly up-regulated the fatty acid transporter and binding protein, fatp1 and fabp11, supporting the elevated lipid content found in the cells treated with those fatty acids. Overall, this study has demonstrated that fatty acids favor lipid storage in gilthead sea bream bone-derived MSCs inducing their fate into the adipogenic versus the osteogenic lineage. This process seems to be promoted via different pathways depending on the fatty acid source, being vegetable oils-derived fatty acids more prone to induce unhealthier metabolic phenotypes."
