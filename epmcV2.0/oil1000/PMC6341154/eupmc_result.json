    "Appropriate germination can improve the nutritional value and bioactivity of soybeans; however, few studies have assessed the effect of germination on soybean proteins. This study examined the physicochemical property, antioxidation, and cytoprotective effect of the germinated soybean proteins (Gsp). Gsp was extracted from soybeans which germinated for 0-3 days using the method of alkali-solution and acid-isolation extraction. The results showed that germination could digest soybean proteins into the smaller molecules; enhance the degree of hydrolysis, emulsifiability, and foaming capacity; increase the removal rate of ABTS, DPPH, O2- ˙, and ˙OH radical; and decrease the reducing power and lipid peroxidation of Gsp. Additionally, Gsp was able to protect HL-7702 human hepatocyte cells against benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-induced cytotoxicity through mediating the cell cycle arrest, suppressing apoptosis, and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This work demonstrated that germination could enhance the physicochemical property and antioxidant activity of Gsp, which also displayed the remarkable cytoprotective effect. This study provided a fundamental basis for substantiating dietary of Gsp used for resistance to oxidation and hepatic injury."
