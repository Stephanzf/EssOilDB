    "The aim of this study is to determine the some physicochemical (proximate composition, pH and aw values) and reconstitution (wettability, dispersibility and solubility index (SI)) properties of spray-dried bone broth powder (BBP) along with the effects of the addition of different carrier agents. Subsequently, the powdered products were stored to determine the storage stability (pH, lipid oxidation, color, browning index) for 3 mon at -18℃. For this purpose, firstly marrow-containing bones (Os femur and Os humerus) have been boiled to get the bone broth. Three different emulsions were respectively prepared (1) 20% maltodextrin (MD) added BBP, (2) 20% whey powder isolate (WPI) added BBP and (3) 10% MD and 10% WPI added BBP and the emulsions were dried using a spray-dryer with 185℃ inlet and 95℃ outlet temperature. The proximate composition and reconstitution properties of BBP were found statistically different (p<0.05) depending on the use of different carrier agents. MD added BBP showed uniform and smooth morphology. The color, browning index, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and pH values of BBP significantly changed (p<0.05) during storage. In conclusion, both the results of physicochemical and storage period analyses showed that the most suitable encapsulation material in the production of the bone broth powder is MD."
