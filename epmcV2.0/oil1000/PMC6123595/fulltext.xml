However, the current study showed that this biosurfactant could not destabilize the model emulsion prepared with span-80-kerosene: Tween-80-distilled water with 30:70 ratios. Some effective factors were reported such as culture age, pH and temperature on demulsifying activity. Therefore, pH and temperature with effects on the ionization of emulsion ingredients or any ionized group on the bacterial surfaces and the viscosity of oil phases, respectively, could be effective on demulsifying activity (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Many species of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> produce rhamnolipid but there are some reports of lipopeptides produced by <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> BD5 and <italic>P. putida</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Acid precipitation is commonly used to purify glycolipid (rhamnolipid) while for purifying lipopeptide, solvent extraction is frequently used but some authors used acid precipitation as well (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to purify the majority of high molecular weight biosurfactants with a considerable amount of protein contents (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, a very few articles used this method to purify rhamnolipids. In this method after centrifugation, floating materials contained high concentration of biosurfactants (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The result of preliminary characterizations showed that produced biosurfactants contained some hydrocarbon and lipid compounds and suggested it was glycolipid as expected from species of <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Moreover, the result of ESI-MS confirmed rhamnolipid production with this isolate and it showed 4 different congeners of rhamnolipids (Rha-Rha-C10, Rha-Rha-C8-C10, Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and Rha-Rha-C10-C12:1) in the partially purified biosurfactant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> sp. ZN produced rhamnolipids during exponential phase and a wide range of C/N ratios between 10 and 40 had no significant effect on production process. On the other hand, the ability of biosurfactant production in the presence of cooked oil and n-hexadecane is indicative that the using of this strain in order to biodegradation of light fractions of crude oil and wastes of food industries has been optimistic.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical issues (Including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication
