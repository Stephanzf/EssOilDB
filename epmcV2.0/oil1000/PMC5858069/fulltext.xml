This goal is hard to achieve without endodontic therapy in most patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] <italic>Enterococci</italic> are responsible for most of the primary infections of the root canal system. They have been isolated from many treated root canals with chronic apical periodontitis and failed root canal treatment.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] These bacteria are capable of invading the dentinal tubules. They can tolerate different ecological conditions, well adapt to unfavorable intracanal environment, and are multidrug resistant. <italic>Enterococci</italic> are highly sensitive to sodium hypochlorite and also chlorhexidine (CHX). However, their sensitivity decreases with a reduction in the concentration of these antimicrobial agents.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Since inadequate cleaning and shaping as well as debris pushed into the root canal are among the factors responsible for root canal treatment failure, different irrigating solutions are used for cleaning and disinfection of the root canal system.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Irrigating solutions must have low cytotoxicity and surface tension, adequate flow, and sustained antimicrobial activity. Moreover, they must be easily accessible and affordable and have a pleasant odor. An irrigating solution with high antimicrobial activity and insignificant adverse effects is obviously preferred.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Due to extensive antimicrobial activity, CHX has several applications in dentistry, and due to strong antimicrobial activity, relatively long substantivity, and lack of toxicity, CHX is considered a favorable irrigating solution for root canals. However, its frequent use results in dental stains, burning sensation of the mucosa, xerostomia, gingival desquamation, impaired taste, and adverse systemic complications if swallowed accidentally.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Since there are numerous side effects of chemical agents and emerging resistance of bacteria to these agents, researchers have been in search of herbal products with antimicrobial, antifungal, and anticancer properties since herbal medications often have minimal side effects and are affordable. However, studies on the properties of organic compounds for dental applications are not many. Four medicinal plants harvested in Iran with significant antibacterial properties, which have been traditionally used for the treatment of oral and dental conditions, are evaluated in this study.</p><p><italic>Prangos ferulacea</italic> (PF) is native to Iran and possesses significant pharmaceutical, nutritional, and antioxidant properties. Strong antibacterial properties of this plant against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have been previously confirmed.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] <italic>Ziziphora tenuior</italic> (ZT) grows on mountain slopes.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The extract of some species of this plant such as <italic>Ziziphora clinopodioides</italic> and <italic>Ziziphora persica</italic> is capable of preventing the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] <italic>Ferula gummosa</italic> (FG) has extensive antibacterial properties as well.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Essential oil of the seeds of this plant has strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] <italic>Dracocephalum moldavica</italic> (DM) has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against pathogens such as <italic>Streptococcus mutans, Micrococcus luteus, S. aureus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>To the best of authors' knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the antibacterial activity of the aforementioned four medicinal plants against oral and dental pathogens.

Essential oils were extracted using the Clevenger apparatus via the distillation method. Analysis of the essential oil was carried out using gas chromatography/mass chromatography.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Tested microorganisms</title><p><italic>S. mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> strains were obtained and microbiologically approved. Microorganisms were stored in brain&#x02013;heart infusion broth containing 15% glycerol (v/v) at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Before the experiment, microbial suspension was transferred to nutrient broth and incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. The turbidity of the inoculum suspension was adjusted at 0.5 McFarland standard concentration to achieve 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> colony-forming units/ml. Double-seriated dilution in 0.1% (w/v) suspension of peptan in distilled water in nutrient agar was used to ensure the viability of microorganisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Disc diffusion method</title><p>Assessment of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils was done using the well-plate method. Standard strain <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (ATCC51299) was used for this purpose. After culturing <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in blood agar medium, 0.5 McFarland microbial suspension in saline was prepared. For this purpose, 0.5 mL of 1.175% barium chloride solution was added to 99.5 mL of 1% sulfuric acid. Next, bacterial suspension was streak cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar using a cotton swab. Wells were created in the plate using a sterile Pasteur pipette, and 50 &#x003bc;L of each essential oil was inoculated into the wells. After 15 min, the plates were incubated at 35&#x000b0;C&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C for 18&#x02013;24 h. The diameter of the growth inhibition zone was measured by a ruler and reported in millimeters. Gentamycin was used as control in disc diffusion method.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration</title><p>To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of essential oils, micro-broth dilution method was used; 5% dimethyl sulfoxide was used to dissolve the essential oils. In addition, 100 &#x003bc;L of fresh culture medium was added to nine wells of each row. These materials were added to the first well to reach a final concentration of 1:200 (v/v) (1 &#x003bc;L of essential oil + 10 &#x003bc;L of dimethyl sulfoxide + 89 &#x003bc;L of the culture medium). Next, 100 &#x003bc;L of the first well was removed and added to the second well and mixed by pipetting up and down ten times. The same was repeated for the next wells and 100 &#x003bc;L of the 7<sup>th</sup> well was discarded (not added to the 8<sup>th</sup> well). The 8<sup>th</sup> well served as the positive control (contained bacteria without essential oils) and the 9<sup>th</sup> well served as the negative control (without essential oils or bacteria to control for sterility). Next, 100 &#x003bc;L of microbial suspension was added to the 8<sup>th</sup> well and 100 &#x003bc;L of sterile culture medium was added to the 9<sup>th</sup> well. Serial dilutions of essential oils (1:200, 1:400, 1:800, 1:1600, 1:3200, 1:6400, and 1:12800 v/v) were prepared as follows; 100 &#x003bc;L of 0.5 McFarland standard concentration of the microbial suspension was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 18&#x02013;24 h. Minimum concentration of essential oil with no turbidity was considered as the MIC. For MBCs with this culture (subculture) of transparent tubes (no growth), MIC test was performed and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) as the concentration that kills 99.9% or more of the initial inoculation is considered.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study assessed the antibacterial effect of PF, ZT, DM, and FG on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> using broth micro dilution and disc diffusion methods.

Despite the available studies on the antibacterial activity of PF, ZT, DM, and FG, their effects on oral and dental pathogens have not been extensively evaluated. This study assessed the antibacterial effects of essential oils of the aforementioned four medicinal plants on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> using micro-broth dilution and disc diffusion methods. As reported in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, all the four essential oils had antibacterial effects on <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and ZT had the greatest antibacterial activity. Assessment of the mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone using disc diffusion method showed higher antibacterial activity of PF and ZT than that of CHX. The mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> for PF had a small difference with that of ZT. Similarly, Ozturk and Ercisli indicated that <italic>Z clinopodioides</italic> and <italic>Z. persica</italic> extracts inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Since all these species belong to the same family of plants, their findings were in agreement with ours.

They also found that <italic>Z. clinopodioides</italic> had no significant antimicrobial activity against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which was different from our study. This difference may be due to differences in plant species and bacterial strains used.

However, we instead evaluated CHX as the gold standard antimicrobial mouth rinse to somehow compensate for this limitation.</p><p>Evaluation of essential oils of plants in our study instead of aqueous or alcoholic extracts evaluated in previous studies was due to the fact that effective compounds (which have antimicrobial activity) have higher concentrations in essential oils than in extracts.
