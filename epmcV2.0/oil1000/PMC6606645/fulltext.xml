Sterol-induced membrane changes are also at the core of eukaryotic cell division, and thus, the emergence of sterols has long been recognized as a critical step in the development of the eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Hopanoids and sterols are biosynthetically and functionally related polycyclic triterpenoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Most bacteria rely on hopanoid lipids to realize functions performed by eukaryotic sterols but their functional overlap is still unclear. However, a few bacteria produce sterols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The function of bacterial sterols is currently unknown and the occurrence of sterol synthesis genes in bacteria has mostly been attributed to lateral gene transfer (LGT), either from eukaryotes to bacteria, or between bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This conundrum is exacerbated by the unclear evolutionary origins of both eukaryotic and bacterial sterol synthesis, despite the former&#x02019;s key role in eukaryogenesis, and the importance of sterols for geochemical dating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, where their presence is usually interpreted as evidence of eukaryotic life.</p><p id="Par5">The role of sterols in bacteria is understudied. Sterol function has been investigated in the myxobacteria <italic>Stigmatella aurantiaca</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which produces cycloartenol, a sterol mostly synthesized by plants. An insertion mutant of the cycloartenol synthase gene of <italic>S. aurantiaca</italic> was compared to the wild-type strain by transmission electron microscopy, and neither growth nor membrane structure phenotypes were detected. No mutant phenotypes were observed for other characters, such as ethanol sensitivity, swarming, or aggregation. It was thus concluded that sterol production is dispensable for growth in <italic>S. aurantiaca</italic>, a proteobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In order to broaden the studies of sterol function in bacteria, we experimentally investigated the contribution of sterol synthesis in <italic>Gemmata obscuriglobus</italic>, a member of the phylum <italic>Planctomycetes</italic>, unrelated to <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. Further reasons to select <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> include that it possesses the most minimal sterol synthesis pathway yet reported, producing only lanosterol and its isomer parkeol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> is the only planctomycete reported to produce sterols while all its relatives are potentially hopanoid producers. Also, the majority of planctomycetes have a complex endomembrane system, although it is arguably most developed in this species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In eukaryotes, the membrane composition of sterols contributes to the function and organization of the cell&#x02019;s endomembrane system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> is ideally suited to study the functional differences between hopanoids and sterols.

Sterols are synthesized from squalene by the enzymes squalene monooxygenase (Sqmo) and oxidosqualene cyclase (Osc). We independently interrupted the <italic>sqmo</italic> and <italic>osc</italic> genes, which are co-located in the <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Wild-type and mutant cells interrupted in non-essential genes form colonies on solid media after approximately 10 days of growth. Colonies were observed for the <italic>sqmo</italic> and <italic>osc</italic> mutants only after nearly a month. These colonies were of a more intense red color than the wild-type ones (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Transconjugants were unable to grow when they were transferred to fresh solid medium or liquid broth, even in the presence of exogenous lanosterol. Thus, the mutant cells are unable to sustain normal unlimited growth. We speculate that the sterol-depleted colonies were able to undergo a few cycles of division, although inefficiently, by dilution of residual sterols present in their membranes. In order to demonstrate that the observed phenotype was due to the lack of sterols and not to plasmid integration, a similar plasmid containing a fragment of the <italic>sqmo</italic> gene under its own promoter was transferred into the wild-type strain. This chromosomal integration resulted in reconstruction of the wild-type operon, alongside the disrupted version, and produced cells resembling wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Colonies appeared following 10 days of incubation, and in contrast to the interrupted mutants, these transconjugants could be regrown in liquid and solid medium, demonstrating that the <italic>osc</italic> or <italic>sqmo</italic> gene interruption was responsible for the originally observed no-growth phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chemical inhibition of squalene monooxygenase</title><p id="Par8">We next applied a chemical approach that, in contrast to the genetic strategy, allowed partial inhibition of sterol synthesis, to permit further characterization of sterol depletion phenotypes. Terbinafine hydrochloride is an allylamine anti-fungal compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> that specifically inhibits squalene epoxidase in fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Based on sequence homology between <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> and eukaryotic Sqmo proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we predicted that terbinafine hydrochloride could specifically inhibit the <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> Sqmo enzyme. Terbinafine treatment indeed reduced <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), and a reduction in total sterol levels was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), suggesting that the growth defect was specifically due to sterol biosynthesis inhibition. Supplementation of terbinafine-treated cultures with exogenous lanosterol substantially improved growth at all terbinafine doses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), supporting our conclusions. Further evidence of sterol essentiality was provided by an experiment in which growth was completely suppressed by treatment with zaragozic acid, an inhibitor of squalene synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, but again rescued with the provision of exogenous lanosterol (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This growth rescue is consistent with that observed in the terbinafine experiment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Lipotoxicity of accumulated squalene has been reported in yeast deficient in lipid storage organelles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and a similar effect cannot be completely excluded for <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> at this time. However, the results of this experiment suggest that it is primarily sterol essentiality rather than squalene lipotoxicity that is responsible for the phenotypes observed in terbinafine-treated cultures and the interruption mutants.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Terbinafine treatment suppresses growth and sterol production in <italic>Gemmata obscuriglobus</italic>, in a concentration-dependent manner. <bold>a</bold> Terbinafine (TB) treatment at various concentrations inhibits <italic>G. obscuriglobus</italic> growth relative to untreated cultures, measured spectrophotometrically over a 6-day time-course.

A series of abnormal membrane conformations were observed, including nested vesicles, stacks of membrane layers inside the cytoplasm, multiple elongated sausage-like structures, cellular space crowded with small vesicles, or a mixture of these features (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

The cells containing inclusions appeared to be undergoing failed budding attempts, although we cannot exclude the possibility of dynamic membrane processes other than budding. Nevertheless, normal division was not observed in any cell containing an inclusion, and some of these cells appeared to prematurely release a phase-bright bud. The presence of inclusions was also associated with external cell debris, most likely related to that observed in the <italic>sqmo</italic> mutant (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Addition of exogenous lanosterol led to the disappearance of these structures and to the rescue of budding replication (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref> and Supplementary Movies&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
