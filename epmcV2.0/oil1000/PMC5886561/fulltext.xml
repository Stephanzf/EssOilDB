Such fossils are famous for their perfect, life-like appearance. However, preservation quality is vast with many sites showing only cuticular preservation, or no fossils. The taphonomic processes that control this range are largely unknown; as such, we know little about potential bias in this important record. Here we employ actualistic experiments, using, fruit flies and modern tree resin to determine whether resin type, gut microbiota, and dehydration prior to entombment affects decay. We used solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) to confirm distinct tree resin chemistry; gut microbiota of flies was modified using antibiotics and categorized though sequencing. Decay was assessed using phase contrast synchrotron tomography. Resin type demonstrates a significant control on decay rate. The composition of the gut microbiota was also influential, with minor changes in composition affecting decay rate. Dehydration prior to entombment, contrary to expectations, enhanced decay. Our analyses show that there is potential significant bias in the amber fossil record, especially between sites with different resin types where ecological completeness and preservational fidelity are likely affected.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Newton Fellowship, no number assigned</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2723-0290</contrib-id><name><surname>McCoy</surname><given-names>Victoria E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research is supported by a Royal Society Newton International Fellowship (no grant number assigned) to Victoria E.

The importance of this fossil reserve is best illustrated in what it has revealed about the evolutionary history of insects: for example, it provides evidence for macroevolutionary patterns such as a mid-Cretaceous transition between two major insect evolutionary faunas, which corresponds with the gymnosperm-angiosperm shift [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, preservation fidelity in amber is such that insects retain micron-scale morphological details allowing for accurate comparative anatomical studies with extant taxa: many fossil insects preserved in amber can be confidently placed into modern taxonomic groups on this basis.</p><p>However, the fossil record in amber is subject to bias, which may limit and distort the extent to which the fossil assemblage represents the living assemblage. There are two components to this bias: entrapment bias, which involves the non-random patterns by which organisms become engulfed in resin; and preservation bias, effectively the non-random patterns by which entrapped organisms decay or fossilize. To date research effort has focused on entrapment into the resin [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and a number of variables such as resin viscosity, insect behaviour and habitat and plant defences have been found to be influential [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, fossil assemblages in amber favour the preservation of small, terrestrial inclusions, because these are most easily entrapped in resin flows [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Subsequent to entrapment and entombment in resin it has been suggested that essentially all organisms are preserved [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, recent advances in 3D scanning techniques have revealed a cryptic and surprising variability of preservation quality of internal anatomy, even where external preservation quality is close-to &#x0201c;life-like&#x0201d;. The variation ranges from internally complete fossils, retaining minute details of the most decay-prone tissues, through to fossils preserving only the most decay resistant features, to some which are hollow moulds. This indicates that decay and preservation biases are operating once carcasses are entombed in resin [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Such bias may responsible for some of the patterns in the amber fossil record that cannot be explained by entrapment; for example, the occurrence of non-fossiliferous amber sites [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and taxa whose overrepresentation in amber (for example ants in some Cenozoic amber) cannot easily be explained by their behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The assessment of the ecological completeness of amber fossil assemblages requires understanding of bias in the preservation process of insects, as well as entrapment bias.</p><p>Here we use actualistic taphonomic experiments to determine whether decay and preservation potential of insects in amber, and therefore bias in the amber fossil record, is affected by <italic>i</italic>. resin-type; <italic>ii</italic>. dehydration prior to entombment; and, <italic>iii</italic>. the composition of the gut microbiota.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Variables to account for insect preservation fidelity</title><p>Both resin type and the degree of dehydration of partially-entrapped insects prior to their full entombment have been suggested to affect preservation quality in amber [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which is why we test these variables here. We add the gut microbiome as an addition variable in our experiments for two reasons: first, in sediment-hosted exceptionally-preserved fossils it has been demonstrated to be an important control in decay and/or preservation [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; and second, wild populations of fruit flies demonstrate significant variation in gut microbiota between populations [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Resin type: Resin&#x02014;including modern resin, subfossil copal, and fossil amber&#x02014;exhibits extensive chemical and physical variation [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the preservation of fossils in amber&#x02014;both presence/absence of complete taxa and their preservational quality&#x02014;varies between the major amber chemical groups [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, resin properties (physical and chemical) are likely to exert a significant control on fossil preservation in amber. Physically, resin acts as a barrier to infiltration by external decay agents such as scavengers, fungi, and bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; variations in physical properties such as permeability and viscosity may influence the effectiveness of the physical barrier. But it is the chemistry of the resin which is thought to be critical for exceptional preservation of fossils in amber [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], influencing decay by acting as an antiseptic, inhibiting bacterial and fungal growth and dehydrating the tissues [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The major amber chemical groups show variation in preservation quality [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; there is generally better preservation in Class D amber (e.g. Dominican amber, with 93% of specimens preserving internal soft tissues) than in Class A amber (e.g. French Charentes amber with 0% of specimens preserving internal soft tissues [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). However, this broad pattern is complicated by preservational variation within the major amber chemical groups, (e.g. Lebanese amber, which is in Class A, has exceptional preservation reminiscent of a typical Class D amber [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). To date the influence of resin chemistry on decay has not been experimentally investigated. The only experiment designed to test the role of the entombing medium in preservation encased flies in wax and maple syrup, and compared them to a fly left in air [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Wax and maple syrup are chemically very distinct, but are not good proxies for tree resin in a number of ways including, significantly their chemistry. However, this experiment did show enhanced decay in wax and decreased decay in maple syrup compared to the control [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], suggesting that the chemical composition of the entombment media is more important than the physical barrier provided through entombment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dehydration prior to entombment: It has been suggested that dehydration of the carcass prior to entombment will result in better preservation of the resulting fossil inclusion, and may particularly promote the preservation of labile internal tissues [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This scenario may occur if, for example, an insect is stuck on the surface of a resin flow, dies and subsequently dehydrates in air prior to another flow entombing it.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gut microbiota: Microbes are central to exceptional preservation of soft-bodied animals in sediments; their action on organically-composed anatomy may result in its loss through decay, or its preservation by mediation of authigenic mineral replacement [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Microbes may be exogenous or endogenous, and the latter are likely to be more important in amber preservation because once entombed an organism is protected from exogenous bacteria[<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

This is the first, but important, step in developing a more complete understanding of the resin-type bias in the amber fossil record. To add to this we need to determine which specific characteristics of these two resins were responsible for the differences in decay. Then, different ambers could be assessed on the basis of these characteristics to determine how successfully they could inhibit the decay of labile tissues or organisms.</p><p>Resins influence decay in a number of ways: physically blocking scavengers and external microbes from the entombed carcass, dehydrating tissues to indirectly inhibit microbial activity, and/or or directly inhibiting microbial activity through antiseptic properties. The two resins used in these experiments could differ in any of these factors, for example, different permeability could vary microbe access to the carcass, and different resin chemistry could result in differential dehydration or decay-inhibition rate. There are three potential lines of evidence to understand how the volatile and semi-volatile chemical compounds that differ between the two experimental resins might influence gut microbiota activity: (1) identifying key antibiotic volatile compounds that differ between the two resins; (2) investigate the antibiotic effects of all the 23 compounds of interest on the specific bacteria present in the gut microbiotas of the fruit flies used in these experiments; and (3) comparing the overall volatile composition of the two resins to other essential oils that are more or less effective at inhibiting the activity of bacteria found in fruit fly gut microbiotas.

Carvacrol is one of the 23 compounds that differ between <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin and <italic>W</italic>. <italic>nobilis</italic> resin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s007">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s008">S2</xref> Tables). It is present in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin but not in <italic>W</italic>. <italic>nobilis</italic> resin, which seems to suggest that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin is more effective at inhibiting gut bacteria activity than <italic>W</italic>. <italic>nobilis</italic> resin. However, carvacrol only makes up 0.07% of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin, whereas it is a major component of antibacterial essential oils (e.g. it makes up 81.4% of thyme essential oil [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]) and its antibacterial effects in isolation have been tested at 100% concentration. Therefore, the presence of trace amounts of carvacrol in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin is unlikely to be significant for decay inhibition.</p><p>Many volatile compounds commonly found in essential oils have been assessed for antibacterial activity, but their effectiveness varies depending on the bacterium. For example, (-)-limonene (which is found in similar amounts in both resins used in this study), inhibits the growth of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, but does not inhibit the growth of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> or <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] (two bacteria commonly found in fruit fly gut microbiotas [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). This significantly reduces the amount of data we have to determine the antibacterial activity of the two resins: only six of the 23 compounds of interest&#x02014;carvacrol, carvacrol methyl ether, and 3-carene, (-)-terpin-4-ol, sabinene, and &#x003b1;-pinene&#x02014;have been studied, and their antibacterial effectiveness has only been assessed against 1 (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum)</italic> of the many bacteria (at least 44 genera) found in our fruit fly gut microbiotas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s012">S6 Table</xref>). In our analysis, we only identified the gut microbiota bacteria to the genus level; however the genus <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> was found in our samples and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic> is a very common species in a fruit fly gut [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> resin is enriched relative to <italic>W</italic>. <italic>nobilis</italic> resin in carvacrol, carvacrol methyl ether, and 3-carene: carvacrol and carvacrol methyl ether inhibit <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic>; and 3-carene does not inhibit <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic>. <italic>Wollemia nobilis</italic> resin is enriched relative to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin in (-)-terpin-4-ol, sabinene, and &#x003b1;-pinene: (-)-terpin-4-ol inhibits <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic>; sabinene and &#x003b1;-pinene do not inhibit <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic>. These results only illustrate a tiny fraction of the complex chemical interactions between the resin and gut microbiota activity, and they are therefore inconclusive. Based on this we once again cannot determine which resin should have a stronger influence on decay due to the interaction of volatile compounds and gut microbiota activity.</p><p>Mixtures of volatile compounds may also inhibit bacterial activity, and so we compared the resin composition to the composition of essential oils that do or do not inhibit the activity of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic>. As with investigating the compounds individually, this only reflects a small proportion of the complexity: only 10 compounds were included to describe the chemical composition of each sample; and the samples were tested against only one component of the fruit fly gut microbiota (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum)</italic>. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) does completely separate the essential oil samples into those that do and do not inhibit <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). However, the two resin samples do not fall into either of these groups. Moreover, it is not clear which group the samples resemble more closely; depending on whether inhibiting activity increases along coordinate 1 or at a slight angle to coordinate 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), either <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin or <italic>W</italic>. <italic>nobilis</italic> resin is more closely allied with the essential oils that inhibit <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic> activity. So once again, the results are inconclusive as to which resin should more effectively inhibit decay. In summary, only a small subset of the resin chemical compounds, and a small subset of the fruit fly gut microbiota, have been previously investigated, and therefore the published literature does not capture the full complexity of the interactions between resin chemistry and gut microbiota activity. Moreover, even at this oversimplified level, the results of our experiments are inconclusive as to which chemical compounds and which gut bacteria have the strongest influence on decay.</p><p>Although we cannot explain how specific compounds within resins alter decay trajectory, we can illuminate some of the ways in which resin chemistry is influenced that likely contributes to resin-chemistry biases in the amber fossil record. Resin chemistry is most obviously influenced by the taxonomy of the tree and environmental factors [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. But, even small chemical differences in resin chemistry between closely related trees may be important. Such chemical distinction is thought to be strongly controlled by herbivore faunal composition, [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], suggesting that even the make-up of plant-eating animals in an ecosystem may influence whether or not that fauna is preserved in amber.</p><p>That resin type strongly influences preservation potential means that the diversity of taxa recorded by amber is likely to be related to the tree/resin type at any locality; this may explain the major preservational patterns (such as which sites have fossils, and which sites have the best preserved fossils) in the amber fossil record, in both the presence/absence of fossils or the presence/absence of labile internal tissues [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Gut microbiota</title><p>Our experimental results indicate that very small variations in the gut microbiota influence decay. This is important because gut microbiota in fruit flies are easily altered, allowing for the potential to create a systematic biases in the amber fossil record. Wild populations of fruit flies demonstrate significant variation in gut microbiome between populations, which may be based on the food available in the region [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; this could result in different populations of the same species having different fossilization potential when entombed in amber. In addition, because the gut microbiota must be constantly replenished through eating [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] an organism that has not fed for recently may have no gut biota. In fact, in laboratory analyses of gut microbiota, simply switching flies to a new food medium is enough to significantly reduce the density of gut bacteria, even without a period of starvation [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, even within the same species the types, consistency and quantities of food available in a certain environment, or across different environments may influence its preservation potential in amber. A gut microbiota bias could explain preservational variation between amber sites that are geographically localized and chemically similar, but which vary in presence or absence of an entombed fauna. For example, only 17 of over 300 Lebanese amber outcrops contain fossils [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; and only seven out of more than 100 Spanish amber outcrops contain fossils [<xref rid="pone.0195482.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The similarities in amber chemistry suggest that resin chemistry was not sufficiently different between these sites to explain preservation variation. It is possible that gut microbiotas may have varied between these populations, and this might explain the presence or absence of fossils.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To conclude, the surprising variability in preservation quality of insects in amber means that to read this fossil treasure trove correctly, using it to investigate terrestrial ecosystems and insect evolution, we must understand the biases that operate in creating such fossils. Here we show that decay experiments provide a useful platform with which to investigate bias between different aspects of the amber fossil record.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0195482.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Chromatograms and selected peaks.</title><p>Chromatograms (A, C) and selected peaks highlighting the compounds of interest (B, D) from SPME GC/MS analysis of <italic>Wollemia nobilis</italic> resin (A, B) and <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> resin (C, D).
