EOs are composed of volatile compounds and simply evaporate or decompose leading to their instability. Preparation of EOs niosomal formulation may be a promising approach to deal with these obstacles. Niosomal formulations of myrtle essential oil (nMEO) were provided using non-ionic surfactants and cholesterol (Chol). In the next steps, vesicle size, zeta potential, percentage of entrapment efficiency (EE%) and physical stability of nMEO were investigated. Finally, the effect of myrtle essential oil (MEO) and nMEO on microbial growth inhibition were assessed. Values for nMEO size and zeta potential ranged from 6.17 &#x000b1; 0.32 to 7.24 &#x000b1; 0.61 (&#x003bc;m) and -20.41 &#x000b1; 0.17 to -31.75 &#x000b1; 0.45 (mV), respectively. Higher degrees of EE% were obtained by F6 formulation (Span/Tween 60:Chol (50:50 molar ratio)). Moreover, niosomes have been reported to be stable at 4 &#x000b0;C during a three-month time period. It was revealed that nMEO F6 formulation inhibited growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> at concentrations lower than that of MEO. Overall, it was found that stable multilamellar vesicles were formed in the presence of 0.5% MEO and F6 formulation. This formulation also exhibited better antibacterial activity than MEO.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antibacterial activity</kwd><kwd>Essential oil</kwd><kwd>Myrtle, <italic>Myrtus communis</italic></kwd><kwd>Niosome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>For many years, aromatic plants, such as myrtle, have been widely used for their medicinal properties (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Different parts of myrtle such as leaves, berries, branches, and fruits have been widely applied in the traditional medicine (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Moreover, not only have myrtle leaves been utilized for treatment of diarrhea, stomachache, hyperglycemia, cough, and pulmonary disorders but they have also been externally used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and for mouth ulcer, burn, and wound healing (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Such therapeutic potentials may be related to myrtle's major secondary metabolites including polyphenols and essential oils (EOs) (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>EOs are natural multi-component systems composed mainly of both terpenes and some other non-terpene components (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Low chemical and physical stability of the EOs as well as their lipophilic nature have been considered as the important obstacle to the preparation and storage of the EOs formulations.</p><p>In terms of physical properties, EOs are volatile compounds which can easily evaporate and/or decompose even at room temperature due to very low boiling point and direct exposure to light or oxygen, respectively (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, conventional formulations of EOs can oftentimes cause skin irritation and sensitization. Several approaches including the application of vesicular systems such as niosomes (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) have been developed to resolve these problems. Niosomes are non-ionic surfactants and have been used in drug (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) or gene delivery (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In drug delivery, niosomes are capable of increasing skin penetration and acting as a local depot to provide sustained release of topically applied drugs in the dermis. Due to properties such as biodegradability, non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity, low cost, and superior chemical and storage stabilities, niosomes offer several advantages over other vesicular systems (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). EOs&#x02019; entrapment in the hydrophobic region of niosomes can improve their permeability and stability features, consequently reducing skin irritation properties of EOs (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Niosomal formulations can improve the stratum corneum functions by attenuating water loss from trans-epidermal skin and increasing skin smoothness by replacing its lost lipids. Furthermore, the residence time of drug in the stratum corneum and epidermis increases and its systemic absorption decreases following application of niosomal systems (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It was previously shown by Manosroi, <italic>et al</italic>. that niosomal encapsulation of <italic>Mimusops elengi</italic> flower extract reduced extract cytotoxicity on human skin fibroblast and also enhanced its physical stability (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, at first myrtle essential oil (MEO) was extracted and analyzed and then the niosomal myrtle essential oil (nMEO) were prepared and characterized in for their size, zeta potential, percentage of entrapment efficiency (EE%), and stability. Finally, functionality of nMEO for microbial growth inhibition was measured against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. These bacterial species are responsible for wound contamination, wound colonization, and clinical infections. Also they may cause opportunistic skin infections in immune-suppressed patients. Gram-positive coccid such as <italic>S. aureus, S. epidermidis</italic>, and <italic>M. luteus</italic> may origin from wound infections, impetigo, furuncles, abscesses, and carbuncles. The Gram-negative bacilli including <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. marcescens</italic> are part of normal intestinal flora. However, in some situation they may cause infection in complicating burn injuries and also surgical site (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In this study, we hypothesized that nMEO is more efficient than MEO in drug releasing behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Sorbitane laurate (Span 20), sorbitane monopalmitate (Span 40), sorbitane stearate (Span 60), Sorbitane monooleate (span 80), and polysorbate 20, 40, 60, and 80 were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, USA). 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5phenyl tetrazolium chloride (INT), cholesterol (Chol), Muller-Hinton agar medium, Muller-Hinton broth medium, chloroform, and ethanol were all provided from Merck Company (Darmstadt, Germany).

The potent antibacterial activity of EOs has mostly been related to oxygenated terpenes, such as 1,8-cineole, linalool and &#x003b1;-terpineol. Randrianarivelo, <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that potent antibacterial activity of MEO can be related to 1,8-cineole and linalool components (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Moreover, linalool has previously been reported to be an antimicrobial agent (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>, MEO and F6 formulation have antibacterial activity against the selected microorganisms. No lysis zone was observed in control group consisting of empty niosomes treated-bacteria. In the zone of inhibition determination, nMEO inhibited growth of S. aureus, S.epidermidis, S. marcescens, and B. subtilis at lower concentrations than MEO did. Furthermore, the results revealed that F6 formulation were slightly more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, F6 formulation is more effective against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> compared to MEO. This may be depends on the permeability of niosome to the membrane of Gram-positive coccid.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Diameter of zone of inhibition and MIC (&#x000ec;g/mL) against bacteria by myrtle essential oil (MEO) and F6 formulation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="RPS-13-250-g010"/></table-wrap></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Up to now, a plenty of studies have confirmed diverse therapeutic potentials of EOs including antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anti-diabetic, and anti-nociceptive features (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Additionally, MEO has shown potent antioxidant, anti-mutagenic, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. According to ample evidence, EOs&#x02019; therapeutic effects are likely to be associated with their unique components. For instance, the potent antibacterial activity of EOs has mostly been related to the oxygenated terpenoids such as 1,8-cineole, linalool, and &#x003b1;-terpineol. Likewise, &#x003b1;-caryophyllene, a well-known component of MEO and another EOs, has been reported to function effectively as an antiviral (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, several evidences have indicated that environmental factors as well as other ones such as harvesting season, vegetative period of plant, and length of distillation affect the content of EOs chemical compositions (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Mahboubi, <italic>et al</italic>. considered 1,8-cineole (36.1%), &#x003b1;-pinene (22.5%), and linalool (8.4%) to be the main constituents of MEO, collected from Iran, whose composition content order is similar to that of the results obtained from present study (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Contrarily, other studies determined the constituents of MEO have yielded varying results. For example, the main constituents of Turkian MEO include linalool (36.5%) and linalyl acetate (16.3%) whereas Italian samples are comprised of &#x003b1;-pinene and 1,8-cineole (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Despite having potent therapeutic potentials, EOs are unstable due to evaporation or decomposition even at room temperature (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To overcome these problems, several methods are developed to stabilize EOs. Previous studies have shown that solid lipid nanoparticles were capable of reducing rapid evaporation of essential oil (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Liolios, <italic>et al</italic>. study indicated that encapsulation of carvacrol and thymol in liposome dramatically increased antimicrobial activity (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Unique features of niosomes including superior chemical and storage stabilities makes them a promising carrier for MEO in topical formulations compared to liposomes. However, different niosomal formulations present various physical properties that influence the EE% of active compounds. Hence, we have analyzed the effects of various molar ratios of different surfactants on features of niosomal formulations in the presence of Chol. We found that vesicle yield was low in the presence of Span 20 and Span 80 which could be due to short alkyl chain (C12) of Span 20 and unsaturated alkyl chain of Span 80 (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Based on findings of this study, S/T 60 formulations have larger vesicles sizes while S/T 40 formulations have higher EE% which increases with increment of the amount of Chol from 30 to 50 molar ratios (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In line with our results, a previous study has revealed that alkyl chain length and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of used surfactants have a significant effect on size and EE% of formulations (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Moreover, the length of alkyl chain in turn influences HLB value of the surfactant. Therefore, the higher EE% will be achieved with the higher HLB values of the surfactants (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Ruckmani, <italic>et al</italic>. showed that a decrease in EE% values was accompanied by increased length of the alkyl chain of surfactants (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) while Guinedi, <italic>et al</italic>. reported that lower HLB surfactants led to higher EE% (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>The results of the present study also revealed that all nMEO were stable at 4 &#x000b0;C during 3 months. Additionally, the results showed that increasing Chol content from 30 to 50 molar ratios enhances stability at 4 &#x000b0;C during 3 months. Chol increases the membrane rigidity and stability by altering fluidity of chains in bilayers and increasing the degree of orientational order (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). A previous study determined the stability of <italic>Gymnema sylvestre</italic> extract-loaded niosome through assessing the changes occurring in color, pH, and EE% before and after 90 days of being stored at 4 &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C, 25 &#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C and 37 &#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C. Their results showed the formulations were found to be stable at 4 &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Much consistent with findings of the present study, another study reported similar results about the size of vesicles under the same conditions (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and the increase in the size may be related to aggregation of vesicles during the storage time (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Of all the formulations, F6 had higher stability and lower size changes during storage time and high EE%. Based on the above-mentioned reasons, F6 formulation was selected as the preferred formulation for the next steps including the evaluation of release profile and antibacterial activity. The rate of active constituent release should be determined in order to achieve an optimal delivery system with desired release characteristics for formulation. However, the rate of release and drug retention from niosomal formulation depends on type of drug, so that it can change significantly. In addition, the drug efflux from the vesicles is affected by the chemical structure of the cholesterol and non-ionic surfactants (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In many cases, the drug release profile of niosomal formulations the same as our result is biphasic such as acid ascorbic and &#x003b1;-tocopherol (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>The initial rapid phase may have wide implications for desorption of drug from the surface of niosomes. Also, the second phase is likely to be associated with the entrapped drug being released from the formulation which is a time-consuming process. Being a stabilizing agent, Chol slowed down release of active constituent. Furthermore, the amount of drug released is related to the EE%, whose high amounts led to less drug release (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). It may be concluded that gradual release of MEO may decrease its decomposition and as well increase its efficacy during time. nMEO inhibited the growth of <italic>S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. marcescens</italic>, and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> at lower concentrations than those of MEO. Similarly, in a study conducted by Salvagnini, <italic>et al</italic>., MEO has been reported to show an antibacterial activity against <italic>S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, B. subtilis</italic>, and <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Moreover, Yadegarinia, <italic>et al</italic>., demonstrated that MEO functions against <italic>E. coli, S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>Alteration of bacterial cell membrane permeability, adsorption of vesicles, or the potential fusion to bacterial cell were considered as mechanisms capable of increasing antibacterial activity or decreasing bacterial resistance in nisin/EDTA nanoniosomes. Niosome encapsulation of nisin/EDTA could be gradually released in the medium, hence resulting in longer and higher antibacterial activity during the time (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Previous investigations have indicated that several parameters, such as size, lamellarity, and Chol content could influence the antibacterial activity of niosomal formulations. Akbari, <italic>et al</italic>. showed that MICs of niosomal ciprofloxacin were two to eight-fold higher than the free drug against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> and, moreover, that the best antibacterial effect was achieved with the S/T 40: Chol (50:50 molar ratio) (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Encapsulation of MEO in niosomal formulation consisting of nonionic surfactants and Chol could be a promising strategy to improve the efficacy and stability of MEO. MLVs were obtained from S/T 40 and S/T 60 surfactants in the presence of Chol and 0.5% MEO. Moreover, higher EE% and stability was achieved by F6 formulation. The release profile followed first order kinetics. The results of the present study proved that, in comparison to MEO, encapsulation of MEO in F6 formulation enhanced antibacterial activity against some bacterial spices.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The content of this paper is extracted from the Ph.D. thesis (Grant No. 94/644) submitted by Mahboobeh Raeiszadeh which was financially supported by the Deputy of Research, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, I.R.
