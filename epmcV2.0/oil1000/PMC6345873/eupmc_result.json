    "Research based on quantitative analysis, pharmacokinetics and metabolomics was conducted to explore the effects of salt-processing on Psoraleae Fructus (PF). Quantitative analysis showed that the contents of bioactive components were higher in salt-processed Psoraleae Fructus (SPF) extract than in PF extract. Pharmacokinetics indicated that the overall AUC and tmax levels was higher, while Cmax was lower in the SPF group. In the metabolomics study, the differential influences of PF and SPF on 22 common biomarkers and associated metabolic pathways showed that salt-processing could enhance the effect of PF and reduce toxicity in the cardiovascular and renal systems. The internal correlations among these results, together with the influence of salt-processing, suggested that the effects of heating and newly generated surfactants during the salt-processing procedure were the primary causes of the changes in chemical composition and absorption characteristics, as well as the subsequent enhanced efficacy and minor toxicity."
