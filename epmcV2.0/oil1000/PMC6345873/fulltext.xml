Quantitative analysis showed that the contents of bioactive components were higher in salt-processed Psoraleae Fructus (SPF) extract than in PF extract. Pharmacokinetics indicated that the overall <italic>AUC</italic> and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> levels was higher, while <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was lower in the SPF group. In the metabolomics study, the differential influences of PF and SPF on 22 common biomarkers and associated metabolic pathways showed that salt-processing could enhance the effect of PF and reduce toxicity in the cardiovascular and renal systems. The internal correlations among these results, together with the influence of salt-processing, suggested that the effects of heating and newly generated surfactants during the salt-processing procedure were the primary causes of the changes in chemical composition and absorption characteristics, as well as the subsequent enhanced efficacy and minor toxicity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Young Scientists Fund in National Natural Science Foundation of China (81403102) Key Research Project Plan of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province (19A360001)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Major Research Plan of Shandong Province (2016GSF202041)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> L., a member of the Leguminosae family, is widely distributed in China, India, Burma and Sri Lanka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Psoraleae Fructus (PF), the dried ripe fruit of <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> L., is frequently used in prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and health food due to its functions of preventing and/or treating various physical dysfunctions and diseases, e.g., osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, bone fracture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> diarrhoea and asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A variety of compounds have been isolated from PF, including coumarins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, flavonoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and monoterpene phenols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Salt-processed Psoraleae Fructus (SPF), the most commonly used PF product in the clinic, exhibits stronger efficiency and minor toxicity in the renal system than PF.</p><p id="Par3">The herb-processing method, which is based on herb characteristics and medical need, has been assisting TCM in developing reasonable curative effects for a long time. Processing can enhance the efficiency, reduce the toxicity and/or alter the original actions of TCM. The most widely used ways to process herbs include stir-frying with salt-water or wine, mix-frying with oil, stir-baking with bran, steaming with water or rice wine, and braising with liquorice liquids or rice wine. The change in chemical composition of the herbs before and after processing was considered to be the fundamental effect underlying herb-processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Over the past decades, most research about processing-methods only focused on alterations in chemical composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> or curative effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> individually. However, the relationship between chemicals and efficacy, as well as absorption characteristics that are essential to the therapeutic effect of oral administration, have received little attention. To date, pharmacokinetics has been proven to be an efficacious approach to exploring the intracorporal course of drugs, especially absorption characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Metabolomics, a systems biology approach, is characterized by a holistic perspective consistent with the integral principle of TCM. The system-based mode has been successfully applied to evaluate the comprehensive efficacy of TCM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In light of the above, a novel strategy based on quantitative analysis, pharmacokinetics and metabolomics was proposed in this study to explore the internal correlations among chemical composition, absorption characteristics and comprehensive efficacy, as well as the influence of salt-processing. First, quantitative analysis of bioactive components in PF and SPF extracts was carried out to ascertain the alteration in chemical composition. Second, a pharmacokinetics study was conducted to explore the absorption characteristics of bioactive components. Lastly, a metabolomics study was performed to investigate the comprehensive efficacy of PF and SPF. The internal correlations among these results, together with the influence of salt-processing, were then comprehensively analysed to reveal the mechanism of salt-processing on PF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantitative analysis of bioactive components in PF and SPF extract</title><p id="Par6">The contents of psoralen, neobavaisoflavone, corylifolin, corylin, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, bavachinin and corylifol A in PF and SPF extracts were shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

This could be attributed to the following two aspects. (1) PF expanded in volume, and the internal micro-structure became loose due to the heating effect during salt-processing. Hence, it was easier for water to permeate into medicinal materials, dissolve the bioactive components, and then diffuse smoothly into the decoction in the boiling process. (2) Under the effects of high temperature and sodium ions, linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid in PF could generate sodium linoleate, sodium oleate, sodium palmitate and sodium stearate, which were substances possessing surface activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

This principle could be demonstrated by the following three points. (1) The surfactants generated during salt-processing could dissolve the membrane lipid of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, thereby enhancing the permeability of the membrane and absorption of the components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

The heat from the flame made the internal structure of PF loose and caused the volatile components to vaporize. The combined effects of high temperature and sodium ions initiated the emergence of surfactants, which could form micelles in water, combine with some components to generate complexes and dissolve the membrane lipid of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells. The loosened structure and solubilization effect from micelles were crucial to the increased content of bioactive components in extract. The newly generated complexes and membrane lipid solubility of surfactants made it easy for the bioactive components to pass through the absorption barrier. Therefore, both the enhancements in the content and in the absorption of the bioactive components contributed to the strengthened efficacy of SPF. Moreover, volatilization loss that occurred during the heating operation was the principal reason for the alleviated toxic effects of SPF.

The data were pre-treated using unit variance scaling and mean-centring before PCA, and Pareto scaling before OPLS-DA. The missing value tolerance was set at variable 50% and observation 50%. In SIMCA-P software, the OPLS-DA models were validated using 7-fold cross-validation and permutation testing. The <italic>P</italic> value provided by cross-validated ANOVA (<italic>P</italic><sub>CV-ANPVA</sub>) was used to estimate the model significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Model variance and predictability were assessed by R<sup>2</sup> and Q<sup>2</sup> values. The R<sup>2</sup>X and R<sup>2</sup>Y values represented the explained variation in X and Y matrices, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Customarily, permutation testing with 200 iterations was also performed for further validation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In addition to the multivariate statistical analysis, the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was also applied to measure the significance of the differences observed in PCA score scatter plots, as well as the significance of each metabolite. The <italic>P</italic> values across all metabolites within each comparison were adjusted by a false discovery rate method to account for multiple testing. The adjusted <italic>P</italic> values (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and VIP values (VIP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.5) were utilized together for filtering biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">Moreover, hierarchical cluster analysis and heatmaps were performed by MeV software (version 4.8.0). Correlation networks for disturbed metabolic pathways were constructed on the base of the MBRole database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, KEGG and MetaboAnalyst.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec36"><p>
