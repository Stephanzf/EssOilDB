    "Several plants species have served as food for man because of their nutritional values. However, there is a lack of data on the nutritional benefits of Desplatsia dewevrei. Hence, this study was aimed at investigating the nutrients and chemical composition of D. dewevrei leaves and fruits. Vitamins, amino acid profile, and mineral composition of D. dewevrei were investigated. Minerals found present include copper, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. Vitamins B, C, and K up to the daily standard required intake levels according to World Health Organization standards were discovered in D. dewevrei. The protein score from the amino acid composition was 100%. Phytate and oxalate, which are non-nutritional components, were found present in D. dewevrei; however, in values far below the daily intake required limit by the WHO standard. In conclusion, D. dewevrei from this research finding has convincing qualities of a reliable nutraceutical raw material, which can be properly finished and incorporated into the human diet to harness its vitality."
