    "The purpose of this study was to improve the solubility of resveratrol (Res) by a self-microemulsifying drug-delivery system (SMEDDS). Through a solubility experiment, the pseudoternary phase diagram and ternary phase diagram were used to optimize the Res SMEDDS formula. The optimum formulation consisted of 5% IPM, 20% PEG400, and 65% Cremophor RH40. The water solubility, stability, in vitro release and antioxidant activity of the Res SMEDDS were characterized. The Res solubility in the SMEDDS was at least 1,000 times compared to that in water. The average droplet size of the microemulsion was 28.00±1.67 nm and uniform distribution. The Res SMEDDS should be stored at low temperature and in the dark to avoid light conditions. Res SMEDDS was able to improve the in vitro release rate of Res, and the in vitro release of Res from Res SMEDDS was significantly faster that of Res powder and unaffected by pH value of media. Antioxidant assays showed that antioxidant activities of Res in Res SMEDDS were unaffected compared to Res powder. Cytotoxicity study indicated that Res SMEDDS at the concentration of less than 100 μM was safe. These results demonstrated the potential use of Res SMEDDS for oral administration of Res."
