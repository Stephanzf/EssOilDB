The goal was also to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved and to determine its efficacy against cancer by triggering apoptosis and suppressing tumorigenesis in human colon cancer. The data here clearly demonstrated that oily fractions of <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> act as free radical scavengers, antibacterial agent and inhibited the proliferation of HCT-116, U266, SCC4, Panc28, KBM5, and MCF-7 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The results of live/dead and colony formation assays further revealed that <italic>Teucrium</italic> essential oil has the efficacy to suppress the growth of colon carcinoma cells. In addition, essential oil of <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> induced apoptosis, as indicated by cleavage of caspases-3, -8, and -9 and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase. Moreover, <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> essential oil suppressed gene expression involved in survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in human colon cancer cells. No sign of toxicity was detected <italic>in vivo</italic> after treatment with increasing concentrations of essential oil. Oral administration of T.alopecurus inhibited LPS-induced colon inflammation. This anticancer property of this specie <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> fractions could be due to their phenolic and/or sesquiterpene content (d-limonene, &#x003b1;-Bisabolol, Humulene, Thymol, and (+)-epi-Bicyclosesquiphellandrene). Hence our study reveals the anticancer activity of <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> oil mediated through the suppression of cell growth, cell proliferation, and the induction of apoptosis of cancer cells.

This disease involves many proteins until the first step of the tumor to the ultimate stade. The combination of chemotherapeutic drugs with terpenes could be of great clinical importance in cancer therapy [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most lethal cancers, especially when it reaches advanced stages [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and develops resistance to chemotherapeutic agents over time [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], evolves through a multistep process in which normal mucosa is first transformed into adenomatous polyps and then eventually into invasive carcinoma [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Colon carcinogenesis progresses over many years via molecular events by the modification of genetic sequences, called as the adenoma&#x02014;carcinoma sequence [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Genetic alterations in somatic cells (mutations) include the up-regulation of proto-oncogenes and the down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Using essential oils (EOs) from aromatic plants is one traditional alternative method that has been reported to have anticancer properties [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], against mouth, breast, lung, prostate, liver, colon, and brain cancer and even leukemia [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Numerous nutraceuticals from &#x0201c;mother nature&#x0201d; could be potential treatments for CRC [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These nutraceuticals target various steps in tumor cell development [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and have been shown to potentially halt cancer progression by targeting one or more steps in the cell cycle [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Many researchers have demonstrated the anticancer effect of essential oils [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The chemical composition of essential oils can act as an anti-inflammatory, affecting arachidonic metabolism or cytokine production or the modulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Natural products such as terpenes, a class of molecules characterized by the presence of multiple terpenic groups in their structural moiety, have emerged as alternatives to treat a broad range of human diseases, including particularly cancer and inflammation [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The whole botanical may be better than its active principle [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The Teucrium (Lamiaceae) genus contains many species that are distributed mainly in the Mediterranean basin [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Phenolic and terpenic components extracted from Teucrium species possess the ability to treat obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, as well as antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. <italic>T. polium</italic> protects liver cells against hepatocellular carcinoma in carcinogenesis-induced animal models [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been shown to be an effective and safe chemosensitizer agent for cancer therapy [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>This report describes novel insight into the curative effect of hydrophobic fraction of Teucrium on cancer. <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> (H'chichit ben salem), widely used in traditional medicine, is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. The chemical investigation of the aerial parts has yielded bioactive compounds. Earlier studies showed that some of these compounds inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. Our goal in this report was to investigate the possible use of essential oil (TA-1) and hydrolate (TA-2) of <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> as an alternative complementary cancer treatment, and, in order to elucidate its potential activity and the mechanisms underlying these effects, this species was tested on colorectal carcinogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Analysis of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS)</title><p>The essential oils and hydrolats of the aerial parts of <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively.

There is also data in the literature about the most abundant fatty acids, where Linolenic, linoleic, and palmitic acids together made up 74.2% of <italic>Teucrium alopecurus</italic> collected from Matmata, Gabes (Tunisia), and the highest number of sterols were stigmasterol, sitosterol, phytosterol, and clerosterol [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The cytotoxic effects exhibited by essential oils could be related to an overall action of the compounds present in oils, especially to sesquiterpene compounds [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], phenols, alcohols, and monoterpene aldehydes [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. TA-1, with its bioactive compounds, and hydrosol elicit a cytotoxic effect by inhibiting cell viability. In the study done by El Hadri <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], &#x003b1;-humulene was found to be cytotoxic against MCF-7, HCT-116, and murine macrophage (RAW264.7) cell lines. The cytotoxic potential of &#x003b2;-pinene was investigated in MCF-7, A375, and HepG2 cancer cells and in other different tumor and nontumor cell lines [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In fact, the studies of the cytotoxicity of cancer cell lines towards essential oils demonstrate a great difference between them with respect to their sensitivity to the substances contained in the oily fraction [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] of TA-1.</p><p>Various cell cycle checkpoints act as potential targets for cancer treatment [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several nutraceuticals prevent cancer cells from transitioning from the G1 to S phase. EOs and their constituents serve as effective anticancer substances by targeting cell cycle progression in cancer cells [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In colorectal cancer cells, the maximal alteration in cancer cell cycle progression in the G2/M phase promoted by TA-1 was observed at 24 h. Volatile oils and their constituents serve as effective anticancer substances by targeting cell cycle progression in cancer cells [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thymol, a phenolic compound of Teucrium essential oil, induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Gene products involved in cell proliferation were found here to be overexpressed in HCT116 cells. Hydrophobic and hydrophylic fractions decreased cell proliferation in human colon cancer cells through a decrease of Cyclin D1 and <italic>p21</italic>.</p><p>Cancer cells possess several abilities like resistance to growth inhibition, proliferation without dependence on growth factors, replication without limit, evasion of the apoptosis, and the invasion, metastasize, and support of angiogenesis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>TA-1 and TA-2 were found here to suppress the proliferation of various types of tumor cells. Based on the data in the literature, it is possible to hypothesize that the antiproliferative effect of oily fractions was correlated with major terpenes constituents, &#x003b1;-Bisabolol as a sesquiterpene alcohol, and (+)-epi-Bicyclosesquiphellandrene. In a further study on highly malignant glioma cells, Edris [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] evaluated that &#x003b1;-Bisabolol is considered a promising inducer of apoptosis. According to the work of Tyagi <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], &#x003b2;-sesquiphellandrene was found to have antiproliferative effects comparable to those of curcumin in human leukemia, multiple myeloma, and colorectal cancer cells. d-limonene, as a constituent of TA-1 in a small amount, is able to inhibit cell proliferation and enhance apoptosis [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Another sesquiterpene present in TA-1, namely &#x003bb;-Humulene, has been identified for its pro-apoptotic activities, mainly against colorectal carcinoma [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>A recent report by Escandary <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] also investigated the antiproliferative activity of <italic>T. polium</italic> on different cell lines. <italic>T. polium</italic> has been shown to be an effective and safe chemosensitizer agent for cancer therapy [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting to note that inducing apoptosis depends on an extrinsic and intrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is mitochondria dependent, whereas the extrinsic is triggered by death receptors (DRs) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PARP-1 cleavage induced by derivative compounds of EOs contributes to the change of the DNA repair process in the cancer cells [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Proteolytic cleavage of PARP activated caspases and can be used to detect apoptosis [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. TA-1 was found here to trigger an increase in the expression levels of cleaved-PARP, as well as caspases-3, -8 and, -9 dependent increases in apoptosis. Caspases are activated by proteolytic processing at sites that are themselves caspase consensus cleavage sites [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. An intrinsic pathway was activated in Limonene treated LS174T colon cancer cells [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Some EOs and their components inhibit tumor cell survival through caspase activation, the induction of proapoptotic proteins, and the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Activating caspase-8 is associated with FLICE/caspase-8 inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) decreasing after treatment with teucrium essential oil, which also inhibited the cell survival of HCT-116 cells by downregulating the expression of cyclin D1, myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl-1), X-chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), IAP-1, IAP-2, and B cell lymphoma extra large (BcL-xL) levels. Bcl-2 protein is downregulated by the action of TA-1 on the HCT-116 cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The results obtained here agreed with other reports that hydrophobic fractions extracted from many species are able to change the expression levels of Bcl-2 and <italic>Bax</italic> genes in KB human oral epidermoid carcinoma cells [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, apoptosis and proliferation are linked by cell cycle regulators [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. TA-1 induces apoptosis by increasing the tumor suppressor <italic>p53</italic> as a G1 regulator. p53 activates specific transcriptional targets that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, angiogenesis, autophagy, metabolism, migration, aging, senescence, and apoptosis [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Without a functional <italic>p53</italic> gene, cells lack the DNA-damage-sensing capability that would normally induce the apoptotic cascade [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similar data were reported by Gupta <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] in three colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116, Caco-2, and HT-29) that were inhibited by a triterpene (nimbolide) by repressing the expression of tumorigenic proteins.</p><p>STAT3 undergoes phosphorylation from serine residues [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In general, exposure to TA-1 is required to suppress the constitutive activation of STAT-3 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5(Aiv)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>) in HCT-116 cells. It can induce a decrease of phosphorylated signal transducers and the levels of activators of transcription protein STAT-3 (at Tyr<sup>705</sup> and Ser<sup>727</sup>) in human colon cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This data is supported by another report showing the ability of STAT-3 to phosphorylate in HCT-116 cell lines [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. STAT-3 is overexpressed in several tumor cells, including cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lymphomas and leukemia, brain tumors, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In addition, Teucrium ethereal oil was also tested to see whether it was able to express proteins involved in the angiogenic phenotypes of cancer cells on tumor invasion and the metastasis of human colon cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> by reducing CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) levels and restoring vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as compared with control cells. MMP9 and ICAM-1 participate in the proteolytic degradation of tissue barriers [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The inflammatory process is directly linked to the metastatic process [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which depends on angiogenesis. The potent antiangiogenic effect of TA-1 investigated in HCT-116 was associated with significant inhibition of the protein expression level of anti&#x02013;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus suggesting that this drug is a potent suppressor of tumor invasion through its action on VEGF, which induces angiogenesis by binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase. Chidambara and co-workers [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] investigated the antiangiogenic effect of d-limonene with a preventative effect on colon cancer. Jung <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] showed that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) attenuated VEGF production through the inhibition of ERK-1 and ERK-2 kinases in human colon cancer cells. c-myc as a cell cycle component is down-regulated by teucrium essential oil, and this inhibition leads to growth arrest.</p><p>TA-1 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of Panc28, Miapaca, and HL60 cancer cells by down-regulating Bcl-xL, XIAP, survivin, MMP-9, and CXCR4 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;6C</xref>).

The essential oil administration was prepared by diluting the stock solution of TA-1 by mixing it with 2% Tween 80. After treatment, the animals were kept under observation daily for any behavioral changes, mortality or consumption of food and water. After 7 days, the mice were euthanized, and the liver and kidney tissues were used for macroscopically and histological overview.</p></sec><sec id="s3_14"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> antitumour activity</title><sec id="s3_14_1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>A total of 48 Swiss albino mice (20 &#x000b1; 1.00 g) were obtained from the Animal laboratory of Sfax, Tunisia.

At the beginning of the experiment, the mice were divided into eight groups (6 mice per group) as follows: Group 1 : mice treated by intragastrically administration of vehicle (2% Tween 80 in distilled water); Group 2: served as positive (tumor) control, mice treated by intragastrically administration of LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 055:B5) (10 &#x003bc;g/ml); Group 3: animals treated by intragastrically administration of the essential oil (10 &#x003bc;g/kg/day); Group 4: mice treated by intragastrically administration of the essential oil (20 &#x003bc;g/kg/day). The treatments were started daily, one hours before LPS treatment; Group 5: served as comparator control, mice treated by intragastrically administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (20 mg/kg/day). Group 6: TA-1 LD combined with LPS (TA-1 LD + LPS) (10 &#x003bc;g/kg, body weight/day and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively); Group 7: TA-1 HD combined with LPS (TA-1 HD + LPS) (20 &#x003bc;g/kg, body weight/day and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively); Group 8: 5-Fu combined with LPS (5-Fu + LPS) (20 mg/kg, body weight/day and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively). All the treatments were given orally once daily for 7 days. After 7 days, the mice were euthanized; lung, spleen and colonic tissues were collected to be analyzed macroscopically and microscopically by Hematoxylin &#x00026; Eosin staining. The experiments were carried out according to Guide for the Care and Use of laboratory Animals approved by the Animal Ethics Committee.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3_17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Different parameters were monitored in normal and treated cells.
