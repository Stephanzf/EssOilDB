    "Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6 (Elovl6) is a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, which participates in converting palmitate (C16:0) to stearate (C18:0). Although studies of Elovl6 have been carried out in mammals, the nutritional regulation of elovl6 in fish remains poorly understood. In the present study, the cloning and nutritional regulation of elovl6 were determined in large yellow croaker. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the full-length cDNA of elovl6 was 1360 bp, including an open reading frame of 810 bp encoding a putative protein of 269 amino acid that possesses the characteristic features of Elovl proteins. The transcript level of elovl6 was significantly increased in the liver of croaker fed the diets with soybean oil (enriched with 18: 2n-6, LA) or linseed oil (enriched with 18: 3n-3, ALA) than that in croaker fed the diet with fish oil (enriched with 20: 5n-3 and 22: 6n-3). Correspondingly, the elovl6 expression in croaker's hepatocytes treated with ALA or LA was remarkably increased compared to the controls. Furthermore, the transcription factors including hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β (CEBPβ), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), and cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) greatly enhanced promoter activity of elovl6 in large yellow croaker, and the expression of transcription factors is consistent with the changes of elovl6 expression in response to fatty acids in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, this study revealed that elovl6 expression in large yellow croaker could be upregulated by dietary ALA or LA via the increased transcriptional expression of transcription factors including hnf1α, cebpβ, rxrα, and creb1."
