    "The surface chemistry and adsorption behavior of submicrometer cellulosic and lignin particles have drawn wide-ranging interest in the scientific community. Here, we introduce their assembly at fluid/fluid interfaces in Pickering systems and discuss their role in reducing the oil/water interfacial tension, limiting flocculation and coalescence, and endowing given functional properties. We discuss the stabilization of multiphase systems by cellulosic and lignin colloids and the opportunities for their adoption. They can be used alone, as dual components, or in combination with amphiphilic molecules for the design of multiphase systems relevant to household products, paints, coatings, pharmaceutical, foodstuff, and cosmetic formulations. This invited feature article summarizes some of our work and that of colleagues to introduce the readers to this fascinating and topical area."
