and adsorption behavior of submicrometer
cellulosic and lignin particles have drawn wide-ranging interest in
the scientific community. Here, we introduce their assembly at fluid/fluid
interfaces in Pickering systems and discuss their role in reducing
the oil/water interfacial tension, limiting flocculation and coalescence,
and endowing given functional properties. We discuss the stabilization
of multiphase systems by cellulosic and lignin colloids and the opportunities
for their adoption. They can be used alone, as dual components, or
in combination with amphiphilic molecules for the design of multiphase
systems relevant to household products, paints, coatings, pharmaceutical,
foodstuff, and cosmetic formulations. This invited feature article
summarizes some of our work and that of colleagues to introduce the
readers to this fascinating and topical area.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>la8b01288</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>la-2018-01288d</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Cellulosic and Lignin Colloids</title><p>Cellulosic and lignin colloids are feasible solutions to the pressing
need to adopt sustainable materials, for example, by exploiting their
inherent physicochemical properties, especially considering their
ability to form (supra)colloidal structures. Such aspects are central
to the scope of <italic>Langmuir</italic>; therefore, this article
introduces such plant-based materials in current developments involving
fluid/fluid interfacial stabilization.</p><p>In plants, cellulose
is the main load-bearing component, forming
semiordered microfibrils. Lignin, on the other hand, is often considered
to &#x0201c;act as a glue&#x0201d; between the fibrils and fibers. This
is, however, an oversimplification because other functions are equally
important. Lignin is mostly derived from plants, while sources of
cellulose also include bacterial biofilms and sea animals.</p><p>Among
the various cellulosic materials, the recent popularity of
nanocelluloses stems in part from their fibrillar or rodlike nature,
nanometer size in the lateral dimension, tailorable crystallinity,
and structuring capabilities, which equip them for a vast number of
applications. We consider two basic types of nanocellulose, rodlike
cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and cellulose nanofibril (CNF), where
the latter displays a higher axial aspect. They contain ordered structures
with packed parallel cellulose chains that form a dense network held
together by van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions.</p><p>To keep the internal native crystalline structure, the most common
route to access nanocelluloses is by disintegration of the plant cell
walls. Thus, unlike most synthetic nanoparticles, most nanocelluloses
are produced top-down and preserve, to some degree, the biologically
derived morphology and ordered structure of cellulose in plant cells.
Therefore, the processing method greatly influences their characteristics,
including dimensions, composition, molecular integrity, and crystallinity,
among other properties.</p><p>One may think that the interactions
involving nanocelluloses in
their native or isolated forms are well-understood; however, this
is far from true. The same holds for the second component considered
here, lignin. Because of the growing interest in using biobased colloids,
several aspects need to be addressed with regard to the structures,
self-assembly, interactions, and applications of nanocellulosic and
lignin particles. As for the former, their building block, the cellulose
macromolecule, may be deemed uninteresting given its apparent simplicity
as a linear homopolymer comprising C, O, and H atoms. A very different
perception arises when it comes to the way it assembles in hierarchical
and multiscale structures. In contrast, lignins are heterogeneous
and complex macromolecules. Several questions arise relative to the
native or isolated forms of nanocellulose and lignin:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>How do the structures
they form evolve
in nature to respond to the multiple demands of living organisms?
Can such designs be engineered into new materials after their cleavage
from the cell walls of fibers, following suitable deconstruction protocols?</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>What type of structures
do cellulose
chains make in the native or never-dried forms?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Do the structures involve ordered regions alternating with
less ordered domains? In addition, in regards to lignin, are the isolated
structures branched or not? What type of assemblies do they form?</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>If we consider both cellulose
and
lignin, what is the nature of their interactions in the cell wall?
And how do such interactions play once they are isolated and/or combined
in a given multiphase system? What is the role of hydrophobic interactions
that determine the insolubility of cellulosic structures in water?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Likewise, in the case of colloidal lignin, what is the nature of
their interactions in liquid media?</p></list-item><list-item><label>(4)</label><p>Combined in the cell walls of plants,
cellulose and lignin form an intricate composite that sustains mechanical,
thermal, biological, and environmental stresses (fire, water, pathogens,
etc.). Do they lose such features when separated and used as a single
component, for example, in a solid material or in an emulsion? Alternatively,
once isolated, is it possible to restore some of the properties observed
in the original fiber precursors? This last question has been partially
addressed in the context of solid composites. However, for liquid/liquid
or multiphase systems, this remains an open question.</p></list-item></list></p><p>After isolation, the large density of hydroxyl groups
in nanocellulose
and lignin provides ample possibilities for functionalization, using
conventional water- and alcohol-based chemistries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> In addition, both nanocelluloses and lignin particles display
nonspecific interactions with cellulose derivatives. This facilitates
hybridization and multicomponent materials to be formed. Several reviews
covering a wide range of aspects related to nanocelluloses are available,
including those from our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> In fact, <italic>Langmuir</italic> has published a couple of relevant,
complementary Invited Feature Articles (see refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>)). The first reference compared
the characteristics and properties of lab-made and industrial nanocelluloses,
enticing a growing &#x0201c;optimism&#x0201d; for their deployment in
colloidal systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> The second reference
discussed the generic use of colloidal particles in a range of fluid/fluid
interfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Here we expand on the construction
of supramolecular assemblies at fluid interfaces, a field that is
in the early stages. Lignin colloids are reported less frequently:
while many studies are available regarding their isolation, characterization,
and modification, very limited knowledge exists regarding their structuring
and colloidal behaviors in aqueous suspension, an issue that is covered
here, at least partially.</p><p>The design, isolation, and use of
nano- and microparticles are
relevant to a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary fields, spanning
from food to advanced electronics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> They have been utilized as models to understand the principles that
govern interactions that typically occur in nature. Therein, a remarkable
complexity exists, given the hierarchical, multiscale, and multicomponent
features of biological systems.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Cellulose Nanofibrils</title><p>The most readily
available source
of nanocelluloses and lignins are plants, wood, and forest products
as well as side streams generated during their processing. Within
nanocelluloses, CNFs are usually obtained by disintegrating the fibers&#x02019;
cell walls by strong mechanical shear, following appropriate pretreatments,
e.g., selective acid and enzymatic hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> or chemical oxidation. For instance, catalyzed oxidation is one
of the few processes that isolates truly individual CNF, such as TEMPO
(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-1-oxyl radical)-oxidized nanocelluloses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> which display uniform lateral dimensions. By
contrast, intensive mechanical shearing results in a more heterogeneous
distribution of the lateral dimensions of CNF. The relatively high
axial ratio of CNF, coupled with its flexibility, promotes entanglements
that together with hydration and electrostatic interactions (if present),
trigger the formation of hydrogels at very low concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Cellulose
Nanocrystals</title><p>CNC is typically produced by
controlled acid hydrolysis that selectively targets the disordered
cellulose segments present in the source material, leaving the crystallites
intact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> The resultant nanoparticles are
rigid nanorods of highly ordered (crystalline) cellulose. The most
common CNC preparation method, via sulfuric acid hydrolysis, installs
charged half-ester sulfate groups on the CNC surfaces and ensures
their excellent colloidal stability in aqueous media. Resulting from
CNC&#x02019;s inherent chirality or handedness, it self-assembles into
chiral nematic liquid crystal phases.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Lignins</title><p>Generally,
lignin is removed during isolation
of fibers. However, it has been realized that many advantages may
materialize if (residual) lignin remains in the isolated &#x0201c;ligno-nanocelluloses&#x0201d;.
Indeed, this enables some level of control on their interactions with
water, depending on the composition and type of lignin (which depends
on the precursor plant source).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Thus, we propose that consideration should be given
to (1) lignocellulosic colloids (colloids containing cellulose and
bound lignin), (2) those inherently produced as mixtures containing
nanocellulose and lignin, and (3) colloids that combine the single
components (isolated nanocelluloses and lignins derived from the same
or different sources). It is for this reason that we discuss both
nanocelluloses and colloidal lignins separately but with an appreciation
for new possible uses if they are recombined strategically.</p><p>The recent progress in green, plant-based colloids is swiftly attracting
increased interest in both academia and industry. Here we introduce
the subject with special emphasis on results from our recent work
dealing with the development of multiphase systems, particularly for
the stabilization of oil/water interfaces. The colloidal stability
and parameters affecting such properties are all important when formulating
emulsions. In addition, the size, geometry, and morphology of plant-based
colloids provide new insights and opportunities to address emerging
applications. We highlight a range of uses for plant-based colloids:
in helping to minimize the use of petroleum-based substances, in endowing
mechanical strength, in reducing materials&#x02019; cost, and in developing
advanced green materials. Our anticipation is that this discussion
will trigger ideas for the development of new platforms with impact
in colloidal and material systems. Finally, it is feasible that new
opportunities may emerge by taking advantage of the synergies between
nanocelluloses and lignins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Key Adsorptive Features
of Plant-Based Colloids</title><p>Relevant to this contribution is
the fact that phenomena such as
stability, surface reactions, and mobility play critical roles in
determining the behavior and fate of colloidal particles, whether
they are of synthetic or natural origins. A main emphasis of our work
is the introduction of plant-based colloids in the stabilization of
multiphase systems, particularly the emulsion&#x02019;s oil/water interfaces.
The associated processes and the state of dispersion are principally
regulated by the nature of the colloidal particles and the conditions
of the surrounding medium as well as the presence of dissolved substances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> At the oil/water interface, ionic strength and
pH affect the surface charge of the adsorbed particles, defining the
activity and the stability of the multiphase system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> which can be further tailored by steric interactions, especially
in the presence of adsorbed, soft polymeric layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p><p>In nature, solid composite assemblies are often joined
by covalent
and noncovalent bonds that modulate their dynamic changes and rearrangements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> The case of fluid interfaces is less common in natural system but
of high technological relevance. Here, the adsorption strength of
natural colloids at fluid interfaces is largely associated with the
ability of a given fluid to wet the surface of the particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Thus, a key advantage of utilizing plant-based
colloids is the possibility of selected chemistries and reaction conditions
that can be introduced during their isolation, conducted either by
bottom-up or top-down approaches. Importantly, the geometry and morphology
of the particles are to be considered as additional, critical parameters
that significantly modulate their functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> When evaluating the physicochemical properties of colloids interacting
at the oil/water interface, several aspects come into play, including
(i) the balance of interaction energies of the particle at the oil/water
interphase, (ii) particle&#x02019;s adsorbed conformation at the interface,
and (iii) the relative magnitude of interfacial area covered by the
particles relative to their size or volume (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a&#x02013;c). Accordingly, the interactions
between the particles and the given phases are favored by the right
hydrophilic&#x02013;hydrophobic balance, which is dictated by the inherent
surface chemistry, the particle&#x02019;s dimensional anisotropy, and
the molecular and colloidal flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Examples

colloid morphology and rigidity can be conveniently selected, depending
on their origin and method used for their isolation. Also, their surface
chemistry can be easily altered. Apart from their eco-friendliness
and bio/economic integration, they offer unique properties compared
to conventional, synthetic colloids (those produced from metals and
minerals or petroleum-based polymers). Still, significant challenges
need to be addressed for interfacial stabilization when adopting biocolloids,
also including other polysaccharides, proteins, extractives, and biogenic
minerals.</p><p>Compared to petroleum-based particles, nanocelluloses
possess relatively high thermal stability and insulation properties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> which can be attributed to their density, width,
and cross-sectional area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> and the orientation
of the crystalline axis. Nanocelluloses are also chemically resistant
to the vast majority of organic solvents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> Concurrently, both nanocellulose and lignins undergo degradation
through biochemical pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Moreover,
their biodegradability highlights an effective solution to current
problems that are otherwise faced when using, for instance, latexes
that in the long run pose environmental concern.</p><p>Nanocelluloses,
as the principal plant-based source for anisotropic
particles, are quasi 1D, high aspect ratio nanofibrils (widths down
to the nanometer levels and lengths that can reach several micrometers).
Their flexibility is limited to the crystalline domain of the fibrils
with sizes in the order of 10<sup>2</sup> nm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>d).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> Taking these
features together, it has been postulated that nanocelluloses are
ideal choices for oil/water interfacial interactions as long as the
radius of curvature of the interface is at least above half the length
of the crystalline domains within the nanocellulose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> For example, interfaces with a radius of curvature in the micrometer
scale, onto which CNCs were self-assembled, showed a relatively tight
packing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>d,
right). CNC has outstanding axial elastic modulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>d, insert), and indirect observations
(experimental and computational) reveal the presence of crystal faces
that differ in their density of OH groups or hydrophilicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> This expands the possibility for interactions
at interfaces but in a manner that is not fully understood; for instance,
CNC interacts readily with and stabilizes the oil/water interface,
whereas it does not present significant surface (air/water) activity.
A plausible explanation is that the surface potential of the air/water
interface has an anionic character above pH 4, thus limiting adsorption
of negatively charged CNC in conventional conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> Interestingly, the inherent interparticle electrostatic
repulsions do not affect CNC interaction at the air/water interface,
for instance, in the assembly of highly packed layers constructed
by different deposition techniques, as shown by us,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> and even in conditions above the kinetic arrest concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> Some clues for the elucidation of the structure
of CNC and its potential interaction in an aqueous environment may
be given by its polymeric nature that contrasts, for instance, with
inorganic particles. For example, polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol)
clearly exhibit H-bonding with CNC in the dry state, but the interaction
in the wet state is limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> If one takes
as an example the surface interactions of polystyrene particles with
other multimeric compounds, they are simply explained by the chemical
nature of the polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> This effect, however,
may be limited given the crystalline and highly ordered nature of
CNC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Adsorption of Colloidal Lignin</title><p>In contrast to typical
nanocelluloses, nonfibrillar, spherical, and nano- and microparticles
can be produced from lignin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> Other plant-derived
particles can include biogenic silica<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> and those produced after cellulose regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> Lignin particles can be prepared from industrial side streams
by using a number of methodologies. They are generally designed to
be spherical; therefore, their interaction at the oil/water interface
follows previous findings for particles of synthetic origin with the
same shape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e). The interaction of lignin macromolecules with a given solvent
depends on factors such as ionic strength, pH, temperature, solvent
quality, and, importantly, monolignol composition in the lignin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> In most solvents, lignin is mostly found as
associated structures, for example, in the form of cylindrical building
blocks having 4&#x02013;10 monolignol units, where the amount of monomers
per building block is influenced by lignin concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> An attractive aspect of lignins is their versatility
because they can be obtained with given chemical composition, molar
mass, and solvent affinity, depending on their source and separation
process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> While this can be upsetting
for cracking the macromolecule into monomeric precursors, it is an
advantage in the domain of colloid science, as a toolbox with a variety
of choices as far as the expected interfacial behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Comparison
with Nonbiobased, Synthetic Colloidal Systems</title><p>The library
of available options is rather large if one considers
the currently available nonbiobased, synthetic particles (either organic
or inorganic), which have been designed to adsorb at the oil/water
interface, principally in Pickering systems. The synthesis of anisotropic
organic and inorganic particles has been expanding, for several decades
now, following progress of surface chemistry to control their morphological
properties. An example is that of spherical silica or latex particles
that have been used for nearly a century. Highly reproducible and
facile synthetic protocols have been developed for the fabrication
of spherical particles, but this is quite different in the case of
anisotropic ones, which demand considerably more tedious processes.
Compared to plant-based particles, a significant drawback of the synthetic
counterparts is their expected nonbiodegradability. In some cases,
they can also be a toxicological hazard to humans, directly or indirectly,
for example, via the food chain. Related effects are being evaluated
for plant-based materials, and so far they have been found not to
elicit immune reactions, even after prolonged exposure after introduction
intracutaneously in model animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> The
biocompatibility of materials formed from nanocelluloses can be a
significant advantage compared to typical synthetic systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup></p><p>High surface area, multifunctionality, and controlled network
structuring are easily obtainable with synthetic particles owing to
the bottom-up synthesis where the process itself can be adjusted in
terms of the monomeric precursor, the initiator and, if applicable,
the emulsifier used (e.g., in latexes).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> This is in contrast to natural organic colloids that comprise a
polymeric backbone, when extracted from plants or obtained from bacteria.
Additionally, synthetic particles can be obtained in sizes ranging

regarded as nonsurface-active.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Nevertheless,
the potential of nanocellulose
to self-assemble at the oil/water interface has been successfully
exploited in a variety of applications, both of fundamental and practical
importance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> In the context of this invited
feature article, it is critical to understand the characteristics
and dynamic behavior of nanocelluloses at the oil/water interface.
One of the major factors that dictates their behavior at interfaces
is how they achieve interfacial adsorption or attachment to the nonpolar
phase (oil). The crystalline faces of nanocelluloses are structurally
nonequivalent, showing one with a partial hydrophobic character.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> Capron et al. found that the amphiphilic character of CNC, observed
for the I&#x003b1; and I&#x003b2; cellulose lattices, relied on the (200)&#x003b2;/(220)&#x003b1;
hydrophobic edge plane. Therefore, CNC could adsorb with this less
polar crystalline plane for which axial CH moieties are directly exposed
at an edge truncation at the surface of the crystal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> Thus, the wettability of CNC at the oil/water interface
is controlled by their crystalline orientation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b, left), that is, the hydrophobic (200)
edge is expected to orient toward the oil phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> Moreover, a recent study investigated the relationship
between bending characteristics for all plane directions of CNC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup> It was found that the bending angle that reached
the plastic deformation limit was approximately 60&#x000b0; in all directions,
and particularly, the (200) crystalline plane presented higher bending
potential compared with the others. This finding provides evidence
that the specific crystalline plane of CNC can bend along the oil/water
interface, that is, the small deformation of CNC, accommodating to
the curvature of oil droplets, promotes interfacial wetting and adsorption.</p><p>One question that emerges is still how nanocelluloses dynamically
interact at the oil/water interface. This was investigated by using
small-angle neutron scattering (SANS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref></sup> which suggested that CNC adsorbed as monolayers with varying surface
density, mainly depending on interparticle interactions. Interfacial
multilayers can also be formed if the CNC bears no charges, for example,
after desulfation of CNC produced via sulfuric acid hydrolysis. Furthermore,
the neutron wave vector dependence with the intensity showed that
CNCs were in contact with the oil only via their surfaces but did
not penetrate the bulk phase; no deformation of the oil surface at
a nanometer scale was revealed. The results reinforce the hypothesis
that the (200) crystalline plane of CNC directly interacts with oil
and clarifies that the interaction is limited to interfacial contact.
Similar interfacial contact behavior of CNC at the oil/water interface
has been shown by molecular modeling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b, right panel).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref></sup></p><p>CNC can be easily modified using numerous reactions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and it is possible to take advantage of an interesting
property: CNC&#x02019;s cellulose chains are arranged in a parallel
configuration, resulting in crystals bearing reducing and nonreducing
end groups. Such chemical anisotropy, as far as the difference in
reactivity of the ends of the crystal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup> allows for asymmetrical or end-selective modification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c). An efficient
chemical route to introduce chemically versatile thiol groups at the
reducing ends of CNC was reported by us.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref></sup> Thiolation of CNC at the reducing end was carried out by first carboxylation
of the reducing end aldehyde groups followed by reaction with <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide-1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino) propyl
carbodiimide (NHS/EDC-mediated activation) and final reaction with
nucleophilic amine molecules carrying thiol termini. The selectivity
and extent of thiolation at the reducing end of CNC were confirmed
by transmission electron microscopy imaging of silver nanoparticles
that tagged the CNC termini. These results revealed the inherent chemical
asymmetry of CNC and presented a precise control over CNC self-assembly
behavior on surfaces, broadening the applicability of CNC in versatile
technologies.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Droplet Stabilization</title><p>The effect

that CNCs presented roughly the same interfacial wetting properties
as well as flexibility at interfaces. The aspect ratio more directly
influenced the interfacial coverage on the oil droplets, that is,
CNCs with small aspect ratio formed a dense layer (coverage &#x0003e;80%)
while an interconnected network of low coverage (40%) took place for
the longer nanorods (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). Furthermore, the shorter nanocrystals were shown to promote
individual droplets, whereas longer nanorods were involved in networked

Interactions</title><p>Given the inherent, nonamphiphilic nature of
nanocelluloses, efforts
have been devoted to impart improved interfacial adsorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref></sup> Among them, facile surface modification helps
to engineer the properties of nanocelluloses and to tune their behavior
at the oil/water interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The effect
of nanocelluloses, when used as a component of surfactant-stabilized
emulsions, favors systems with water as the continuous phase. In practice,
this means that emulsion inversion from oil-in-water (O/W) to water-in-oil
(W/O) is prevented; see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c for a map illustrating the possible emulsion morphologies,
depending on the composition and formulation variables. More specifically,
observations as far as the effect of nanocelluloses in surfactant-stabilized
emulsions indicate that the presence of cellulosic nanoparticles is
akin to the effect of a viscosifying additive that displaces the transitional
inversion line. For example, the presence of nanocelluloses limits
emulsion inversion from O/W type to W/O type, as is normally done
by changing a formulation variable, for instance, by increasing the
salt concentration in emulsions stabilized by ionic surfactants. This
is equivalent to moving the inversion boundary upward, as illustrated.
Moreover, if the formulation variables are selected in such a way
to produce oil-continuous systems in the absence of nanocelluloses
(W/O emulsions, for example, if the formulation favors interactions
with the hydrophobic phase), the addition of nanocellulose makes more
likely the persistence of drop-in-drop or multiple emulsions of the
water-in-oil-in-water (w/O/W) type. In effect, this is qualitatively
equivalent to a shift to the left in the position of the catastrophic
inversion line of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c. Note that the changes in the transition boundaries described
here are to be taken only as illustrations to rationalize the effect
of nanocelluloses because, to our knowledge, such phenomena have not
been shown experimentally.</p><p>The transition behavior has been
studied in the presence of a cationic surfactant that electrostatically
modified the surface properties of CNC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref></sup> The results indicated that the interactions between anionic CNC
and cationic alkylammonium surfactants (dodecyl dimethylammonium bromide
(DMAB) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) significantly affected
the interfacial behavior of CNC. Specifically, aggregation of surfactant
molecules on CNC occurred when the concentration of surfactant exceeded
the apparent critical micelle concentration (cmc),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup> which dramatically increased the hydrophobicity of CNC
and enabled better wettability at the oil/water interface. By adsorbing
cationic DMAB, which contains two alkyl tails, a double transitional
change was observed, from enhanced interfacial bending for CNC toward
dodecane at low DMAB concentration (O/W, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c), over curvature reversal to achieve interfacial
bending toward water at intermediate DMAB levels (W/O, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c), to return to the oil-in-water
form at higher DMAB loading (O/W, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c).</p><p>Recently, we used a food-grade
cationic surfactant, ethyl lauroyl
arginate (LAE), to engineer the behavior of CNC at the sunflower oil/water
interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup> The adsorption of CNC at the
interface was studied as a function of LAE concentration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a): three interfacial
adsorption regimes at given surfactant loading were observed, depending
on its structure adsorbed on CNC, as unimer or as adsorbed admicelles.
For instance, at low LAE addition, the emulsion droplets were stabilized
by complexes containing partially neutralized CNC. At medium LAE concentration,
the system underwent a transition from nearly neutralized CNC aggregates
to CNC aggregates containing adsorbed LAE bilayers or admicelles.
At high LAE concentration, the oil droplets were stabilized by both
the complexes containing fully covering CNCs and by LAE molecules.
Finally, the oil phase type influenced the interfacial behavior of
CNC. Both, CNC/LAE complexes and LAE molecules contributed to stabilize
viscous, nonpolar sunflower oil. In contrast, when a less viscous
oil was used, only LAE adsorbed at the interface, and CNCs were preferably
located in the bulk of the aqueous phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref></sup> The results demonstrate a promising opportunity to controllably

such as source, aspect ratio, and surface charge, among others. Because
of the natural hydrophilic character of cellulosic nanomaterials,
most efforts in this field have focused on O/W emulsions. However,
W/O or double emulsions can also be formed by chemically modified
nanocelluloses, via hydrophobization or surfactant complexation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c). As described
before, compared to common particle stabilizers, the advantages of
cellulose nanoparticles include their biocompatibility, biodegradability,
low density, and low cost.</p><p>Kalashnikova et al. have demonstrated
highly stable emulsions with unmodified CNC isolated from cotton,
green algae, and bacterial cellulose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a,b).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> The possibility of
producing functional emulsions with modified CNC was also demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref></sup> We prepared thermoresponsive O/W emulsions with CNC grafted with <italic>N</italic>-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), namely, CNC-<italic>graft</italic>-poly(NIPAM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref></sup> The CNC-<italic>graft</italic>-poly(NIPAM) aligned and layered at the oil/water interface, which
contributed to the stability during a four-month observation time.
When the emulsions were heated above the lower critical solution temperature
of poly(NIPAM), the emulsions broke down. The demonstrated production
of emulsions with controllable stability using naturally abundant
resources is potentially useful for biomedical and cosmetic applications.
Low et al. prepared dual responsive (pH and magnetic) emulsions using
Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;CNC composites for stabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">85</xref></sup> The fabricated emulsions were proposed for application
as smart nanotherapeutic carriers. Ojala et al. studied the stabilization
of marine diesel O/W emulsions with bifunctionalized CNC for application
as oil-spill response agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">86</xref></sup> Apart from
chemical modification of CNC, Pickering emulsions have also been produced
via synergistic stabilization by CNC and water-soluble polymers (e.g.,
hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and methyl cellulose (MC)). By adding
MC to CNC-HEC stabilized emulsions, followed by heating above 70 &#x000b0;C,
viscoelastic emulsion gels were achieved (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>a).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref87">87</xref></sup> The emulsion
gels were stable within multiple cycles of heating&#x02013;cooling.
Kedzior et al. exploited a synergistic effect between CNC and surfactants
for miniemulsion polymerization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>b).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref88">88</xref></sup> The resulting
latexes showed tunable properties (morphology, surface charge, and
molecular weight), which bear potential applications for coatings,
adhesives, and household products. Tasset et al. used CNC-stabilized
O/W emulsions for the preparation of highly porous foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">89</xref></sup> The preparation of composite foams was demonstrated
by the addition of chitosan to the corresponding emulsions.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Applications

increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase is also of interest.
Because of the long fibrillar structure and high aspect ratio of CNF,
they can be effective in the stabilization by their effect on the
continuous phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref></sup> The addition of surfactant
is also useful in tailoring the properties of the emulsion. For example,
we showed that the morphology, viscosity, and stability of emulsions
can be tuned, depending on the concentration of CNF and sodium dodecyl
sulfate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90">90</xref></sup> When the CNF content was increased,
the viscosity of the continuous phase was enhanced, the droplet size
reduced, and emulsion stability improved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">91</xref></sup> We used a nonionic surfactant to compatibilize CNF with polystyrene
(PS) in w/O/W double emulsions (see also <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref92">92</xref></sup> The emulsion
was a drop-in-drop of the w/O/W type, as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>c<sub>1</sub> with the aqueous
phase shown in black and the oil phase in color. Such a system makes
it possible to compatibilize phases with different polarity and, upon
removal of the solvents, to produce composite polymeric structures
with high interfacial areas, which is appealing for numerous applications.
Because of the shear thinning behavior of double emulsions containing
CNF and PS, electrospun nanofibers could be fabricated from such precursors
(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>c<sub>2</sub>). CNF has also been used to encapsulate paraffin in the form of
a Pickering emulsion, which can be consolidated into a phase change
material, as a paper structure for solar energy applications (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>d).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">93</xref></sup></p><p>In the case of W/O emulsions, surface modification
is critical
for emulsion stabilization, e.g., by affecting the wettability of
the cellulosic particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref></sup> Lif et al.
studied water-in-diesel emulsions using nonionic surfactants, sorbitan
monolaurate, and glycerol monooleate as emulsifiers and hydrophilic
or hydrophobic CNF as a stabilizer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref94">94</xref></sup> The
motivation for producing water-in-diesel emulsions was to improve
the emission profile in combustion compared to regular diesel. For
hydrophobization, CNF was treated with octadecylamine or poly(styrene-<italic>co</italic>-maleic anhydride), given that silylation was not suitable
for fuel applications (silicon poisons the exhaust catalyst). It was
concluded that both the surfactant and the stabilizer were needed
to produce reasonably stable emulsions. The most stable emulsions
were obtained by combining hydrophobic and hydrophilic (unmodified)
CNF. Cunha et al. hydrophobized CNF and CNC with lauroyl chloride,
which stabilized W/O and o/W/O double emulsions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref95">95</xref></sup> In the double emulsions, unmodified nanocelluloses were
used to stabilize the inner, oil/water interface, while the modified
nanocelluloses stabilized the outer, water/oil interface.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Food Emulsions</title><p>Because O/W emulsions are an integral
part of pharmaceutical, foodstuff, and cosmetic formulations, either
during production or in final product forms, there is an increased
demand for label-friendly products fabricated from natural and renewable
ingredients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">96</xref></sup> Health and safety issues
have been considered in attempts to replace conventional synthetic
surfactants with nanocelluloses and lignin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">97</xref></sup> Research on food emulsions stabilized by particles has mainly focused
on fat crystals, inorganic particles, protein-based nanoparticles
and chitin nanocrystals, used as stabilizers. Few efforts using nanocellulosic
particles in food-grade emulsion systems have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref98">98</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">101</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that Turbak et al., who pioneered work
on nano/microfibrillar cellulose, first considered their use as food
additives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102">102</xref></sup> Lignin and nanocelluloses
for food have been limited by uncertainty in their availability, regulation,
and cost structure, but this situation may change rapidly, with the
prospects of several commercial units opening production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></p><p>Golchoobi et al. studied combinations
of CNF, guar gum, and CMC in low-fat mayonnaise, an O/W emulsion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">100</xref></sup> The combination of CNF and guar showed better
stability compared to a commercial control sample. CNF was reported
to have a positive effect on the mouthfeel of the mayonnaise. Mikulcov&#x000e1;
et al. studied the encapsulation of essential oils (cinnamaldehyde,
eugenol, and limonene) with carboxylated CNC and CNF to produce emulsions
with antibacterial properties against typical food-borne pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">101</xref></sup> According to their results, the droplet size
of CNC-stabilized emulsions was smaller compared to CNF-stabilized
emulsions. CNF-based emulsions were reported to be stable during a
two-month storage without creaming, which was attributed to a formation
of a strong fibril-droplet network due to the high aspect ratio of
CNF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref></sup></p><p>Safety and regulatory issues
need to be fully addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> For nanomaterials,
it is not possible to evaluate
the impacts on humans and the environment based only on the chemical
characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> Toxicity studies with
nanocelluloses on mouse and human macrophages have been conducted
by Vartiainen et al., who suggested that CNF prepared from friction
grinding is not cytotoxic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref103">103</xref></sup> Pitk&#x000e4;nen
et al. found that CNF did not present genotoxicity or sublethal effects
in in vitro tests but concluded that additional studies are needed

that benefits the stabilization of multiphase systems, including Pickering
templates for microcapsules and nanoparticles, organic carriers for

of particle-based systems. Particle wrinkling is a commonly occurring
natural phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref></sup> In our recent efforts,
wrinkling and other surface morphologies of colloidal lignin particles
produced from the aerosol method were investigated by harmonic analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109">109</xref></sup> It was shown that different morphologies were related to the onset
of buckling transition during the drying phase of the aerosol flow

droplets, over crust and buckling formation, to final structures exhibiting
wrinkling and crumpling (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>b). Wrinkled lignin particles showed a similar surface
roughness spectrum, wherein differences were found most noticeable
in the large-wavelength region. The results are useful in efforts
to design particles with tunable interfacial behavior and wettability.
Furthermore, they provide a means to improve our understanding of
the role of surface topography on colloidal interactions. Finally,
incorporating corrugated surface features in plant-based colloids
might offer an avenue for effectively utilizing, modifying, and extending
their properties.</p><p>Microcapsules with different properties for
utilization in various
applications can be made via Pickering emulsion templates stabilized
by lignin particles. Yi et al. successfully utilized lignin nanoparticles
as a barrier to obtain a multilayer composite microcapsule via a Pickering
emulsion template accompanied by in situ interfacial polymerization
of a melamine formadehyde prepolymer (PMF) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>c<sub>1</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref110">110</xref></sup> Furthermore, the mean diameter of fabricated microcapsules decreased
with increasing lignin content (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>c<sub>2</sub>), demonstrating the ability of lignin
particles to control the properties of a Pickering system. Isophorone
diisocyanate (IPDI) was richly and efficiently loaded into a lignin
nanoparticle-based Pickering emulsion to produce a self-healing composite.
IPDI reacted with water and moisture to form a solid. Thus, IPDI-loaded
microcapsules were incorporated into epoxy coatings, and their anticorrosion
effect was demonstrated on a steel plate (subjected to accelerated
corrosion tests by immersion in a brine solution).</p><p>Tunable Pickering
emulsions stabilized by lignin nanoparticles
were achieved by grafting polyacrylamide on their surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref></sup> The emulsion properties were influenced by
salinity and grafting density, given that they affect lignin aggregation.
Thus, emulsions with a wide range of properties could be produced.
The development of gas-switchable Pickering emulsions stabilized by
2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA)-modified lignin particles
was reported by Qian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">112</xref></sup> The CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> switchability of the modified lignin particles
were finely tuned by the DEAEMA graft density and chain length. The

achieved by alternating CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> bubbling.</p><p>Lignin has also attracted interest in the biomedical field because
of its biodegradability, biocompatibility, and low toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref113">113</xref></sup> Of relevance are its antioxidant and antibacterial
properties. The latter case was demonstrated by Velev et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref114">114</xref></sup> The development of nanostructured lignin has
led to potential uses in drug/gene delivery and tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref115">115</xref></sup> However, there is limited knowledge on the
toxicity of nanostructured lignin to humans. Lignin nanoparticles
were used for drug delivery applications, and a low cytotoxicity of
pure nanoparticles and iron(III)-complexed and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-infused particles was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref113">113</xref></sup> The particles were also indicated to have good stability, were able

of Cellulosic and Lignin Colloids</title><p>It is reasonable to discuss
nanocelluloses or lignin particles
together because they are both sourced from plant biomass, where they
are the main components. They also form stable colloidal systems in
aqueous suspension. However, there is perhaps a more compelling motivation:
nanocelluloses carrying residual lignin exhibit properties that make
them unique. Such synergies have been studied to a very limited extent.
In addition, the integration of lignin (as lignin particles) with
nanocelluloses can become quite attractive if one reflects on recent
developments that exploit the strong interactions between these two
components. This goes from ultrastrong wood panels that are obtained
upon densification of cellulosic fibers in the presence of lignin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref116">116</xref></sup> to the very strong and flexible nanocomposites
produced by mixing modified CNF and an industrial lignin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref117">117</xref></sup> In fact, earlier we introduced the subject
when researching the role of residual lignin in films or nanopapers
comprising &#x0201c;ligno-nanocellulose&#x0201d; (see refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) and references therein). The
question remains whether similar compositions are effective in stabilizing
fluid/fluid interfaces. This is yet to be determined but is a topic
currently under our consideration. In retrospect, such possibilities
are not surprising if one reflects on the role of cellulose and lignin
in the cell wall of plants. Therein, strong interactions and synergies
are part of a multifunctional and hierarchical structure that responds
efficiently to several demands.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Prospects and Conclusions</title><p>Progress on lignin and nanocellulose applications is accelerating

relied on hydrophobic particles that prestabilized the air/water interface
and resulted in a robust network of cellulose fibrils synthesized
by bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref119">119</xref></sup> As a starting point for
related developments, the use of emulsions can be quite attractive. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>, for example, illustrates
the different possibilities, which include O/W or W/O emulsions in

(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>b). Such systems
can be useful in the design of advanced materials. One of the routes
for lignin particle fabrication has been introduced before (aerosol
flow method). If a control in the lignin particle size is wanted,
emulsions can be used to produce such uniform lignin particles, which
can be further crosslinked (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>c). In turn, they can also be used in the stabilization
of emulsions (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>d). The multiphase systems that are presented here, based on nanocelluloses
or lignins, are ideal for the fabrication of microbeads, hollow microcapsules,

develop extensively and profoundly, evolving from fundamental insights
to practical aspects. The inherent ability of ligno-nanocellulose

the gap between bulk properties and unique product functions; however,
the modification always leads to alterations of physicochemical properties,
which is undesirable for green resources. As for the toxicity of modified
ligno-nanocelluloses, efforts should be devoted to maintaining its
biocompatibility while achieving the expected performance. Furthermore,
although ligno-nanocellulose has been commercially used in the biobased
field, developing facile, efficient, and green technologies for production
and postprocessing should be considered.</p><p>Research on the dynamic

is of great interest. They can reduce the need for synthetic materials
used in colloid systems and will open new opportunities for revealing
novel functional applications
of structurally defined natural nano- and microparticles. We leave
this feature article with some questions that were partially addressed
but remain open for discussion: What factors affect the assembly of
plant-based colloids at the oil/water interface? What are the dynamics
of nanocelluloses and lignin particles adsorbed at the interfaces?
What applications and properties are possible as a result of the stabilization
of fluid/fluid interfaces, in the form of emulsions with given morphologies?
How can nanocelluloses and lignin particles be combined to develop
yet new compositions that exploit their interesting synergies? Are
there other plant-based colloidal materials that should be considered,
