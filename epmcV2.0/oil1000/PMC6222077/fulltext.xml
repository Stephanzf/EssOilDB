This process is based on the volatility of fugacious compounds where, the raw materials are exposed to saturated vapor for a short period of time, which varies by product type. Extraction of citrus essential oil performed by hydro-distillation with ambient pressure is traditionally used. Today, citrus fruit is extensively grown from temperate to tropical zones within the northern and southern. In the processing of citrus, the peels remain as a waste. One of the products from citrus peel is essential oil that is aromatic liquids characterized by an odor and produced by citrus peels (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Guenther, 1948</xref>). Essential oil Citrus is intensively collected in oil glands of the peel (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Boussaada et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), accounting for about 1&#x02013;3% fresh weight on average (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Njoroge et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Essential oil Citrus is a complex combination of natural ingredients that can contain compounds with different concentrations and has significant applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Due to the attention of various industries to this valuable product, the presence of the essential substance of limonene (the major combination of essential oils in orange peel), which has antimicrobial, antioxidant, biological properties and herbal fragrance (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Recently, Citrus essential oil has been acknowledged no longer handiest for its fragrant features however additionally for its physiological homes, along with chemo-prevention in opposition to most cancers and aromatherapy consequences (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dorman and Deans, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Murthy et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">The main component of citrus essential oil is limonene. Its concentration in the oil differ between 30% and 99%, be depending on the variety: 30&#x02013;40% in bergamot, 40&#x02013;75% in lemon and 68&#x02013;98% in sweet orange (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Moufida and Marzouk, 2003</xref>). Limonene is a monoterpene whose empirical formula is C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16.</sub> It is a liquid at room temperature. It exists as two optical isomers D- and L-limonene, and the racemic combination known as dipentene. The main industrial use of limonene is a precursor to carvone or a-terpineol (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Boluda-Aguilar and L&#x000f3;pez-G&#x000f3;mez, 2013</xref>). The extraction method modifies depending upon the final application. Thus, the preferred extraction methods are the steam distillation, cold expression and other methods inclusive of extraction with lipophilic solvents, supercritical fluids, and steam explosion are used (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Allaf et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bakkali et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Through the use of steam to mediate the extraction, it is possible to hold little conditions and gain better extraction. Steam explosion is a valuable and important technology to open up the biomass fibers, to enhance the healing of waste and different useful compounds from plants. The steam contacts a admixture and targets the substance(s) which has the high boiling point. The steam carries the desired substance(s) into another vessel through a condenser. The product, i.e. the mixture of hot vapors will, if let to pass through a cooling system (vacuumed tank), condense to form a liquid in which the oil and water include two separate layers (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ozel and Kaymaz, 2004</xref>) (Aqueous phase &#x00026; organic phase) or it will be as an emulsion. The organic part may be an essential oil and other volatile compounds. This process subjects the product to fast transition from high steam pressure to hoover. This transition induces a quick evaporation of water and unstable compounds. It is also discussed as pretreatment procedure for the production of solid biofuel pellets to increase the calorific value and to improve the pelletizing properties of the biomass (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Jedvert et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">In this work, we investigated that processing by steam explosion increase the total diffusivity of the liquid in peels and improve the supply of the liquid in the citrus peels. The essential oil removal based on this research is an appealing substitute to typical techniques of essential oil extraction, such as hydro-distillation or isolation with solvents. Moreover, in comparison to the steam explosion and hydro-distillation, the quick time contact between peels and the heated zones of equipment avoids the loss and degradation of unstable and thermolabile compounds (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">X.-M. Li et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). At the industrial scale, that is exciting regarding oil quality and energy saving.</p><p id="p0030">The principle of this work was to get better an efficient process for extraction of essential oil from orange peel through a thermo-mechanical extraction technique developed in steam explosion process. This process is based by subjecting the product to a fast transition from the high steam strain chamber to a vacuum tank. For such products as citrus peels, the purpose became a upkeep of perfume coupled to an alveolate texture of the dried product. So, this technique used for the separation of essential oil from the solid material. An integrated technique for steam extraction accompanied via volatiles sampling and analysis from the essential oils of the citrus peels become explored. There have been two situations to overcome in the extraction from solid plant resources: that of releasing the essential oils from a solid matrix and letting it diffuse out efficiently in a manner that can be scaled-up to commercial volumes. In the direction of this give up, the impact of various parameters, such as pressure and extraction time at the extraction yield was investigated and the experimental outcomes display that all of these time, were significant parameters affecting yield. In addition, extraction of essential oil of drying peels was approved using hydro-distillation and their performance was compared to the steam explosion. The quality and comparison of its content were then based on the effect of test variables validated by GC-MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Raw material</title><p id="p0035">Orange fruit used in this research were Citrus sinensis Osbeck CV.

This volatile aroma compounds and water forms an azeotropic (azeotropes<bold>)</bold> mixture, which can be evaporated together at the similar pressure and after that condensed and divided in a Florentine flask due to their density difference and immiscibility.

Pressure, temperature and time are main factors in the design of an extraction method. One of the shortcomings observed in hydro-distillation experiments is the fact that during the process, temperature and pressure cannot be controlled. On the other hand, the amount of distillation of the essential oil extracted from the peels is highly dependent on the temperature and corresponding pressure of extraction. In order to compare the essential oil yield, hydro-distillation is considered as a reference treatment, and each experiment was carried out in five repetitions for four hours. The temperature was set to the boiling point of water and the pressure was slightly higher than the environment. The average yield of the extracted essential oil turns out to be 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.1 ml/g dry material (dm) and in range of 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 ml/g (dm) to 1.30 &#x000b1; 0.1. In all the treatments, three separate intervals were observed. In the first interval, the extraction rate remained constant. In the next interval, this rate was increased significantly while it became constant in the third interval (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). A reason for the existence of these time intervals may be explained as follows (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allaf and Allaf, 2016</xref>): During the first part of the heating, a breakdown of cell structures begins. As the heating continues, the rate of cell breakdown increased significantly until all the structure is degraded. This means that the penetration of solvent in the tissue, the rate at which oil was removed from the peel is solely dependent on the heating time. The result (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>), can be explained by the fact that the rate of oil separation from the plant material is affected by availability of the relative essential oils in pore what make up the oil; rather it is influenced by their solubility in the liquid phase. Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that it should take time that could still be trapped within the tissues of the plant (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allaf and Allaf, 2016</xref>) inaccessible to the water phase.<fig id="fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Hydro-distillation pretreatments with essential oil extraction yield (ml).</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0025">Fig.&#x000a0;4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Extraction of essential oil by steam explosion</title><p id="p0085">The steam explosion pretreatments of orange peels were performed in a pilot plant.

To justify this process behavior can be said that agitation of the surrounding solvent (vapor) normally allows the transport of solute from the product surface to the outside by convection (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Balasubramaniam et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). By adding a vacuum step, the efficient exchange surfaces achieve a higher rate than the flat surface. Also, the decompression creates a larger temperature discrepancy between the two steps only before and after decompression. Indeed, the pressure difference is the dynamic force in the change in the pore size with time. The rate of change of pore size is thus proportional to the pressure discrepancy between the inside of the pore and the external medium.<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Steam explosion pretreatments with essential oil (EO) extraction yield (ml) in pressure 3&#x02013;12 Bar.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0030">Fig.&#x000a0;5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig><fig id="fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Steam explosion extraction pretreatment with essential oil extraction yield (ml) in pressure 10 bar.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0035">Fig.&#x000a0;6</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr6"/></fig><fig id="fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Essential oil extraction yield vs. time in pressure 3&#x02013;12 Bar by steam explosion pretreatments.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0040">Fig.&#x000a0;7</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></p><p id="p0095">The best temperature and pressure range for the steam explosion process was in the range of 8&#x02013;12 bars and 260&#x02013;240 s, respectively. The temperature increased due to increasing pressure, the process time must reduce because peels are burned. So the efficacy of temperature is as a variable depending on the pressure. Therefore, in comparison with the hydro-distillation method, the yield increased and the extraction time decreased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>).

It is significant to note that the natural organization of some plants such as citrus peels prevents an easy essential oil extraction. We first extracted the essential oils hydro-distillation and steam explosion. The extraction performed by hydro-distillation showed that mechanical process, in this case grinding, was necessary. Therefore, in the steam explosion mechanical (illustrated by the pressure) and thermal (illustrated by the steaming time t) processes can be combined for this specific material. Pre-treatment by the steam explosion can improve extraction yields and kinetics. The swelling of the cells enabled a improved kinetic extraction in conditions of diffusivity and starting accessibility. Investigations with a steam explosion at industrial scale equipment could be realized for industry tests. This process can have a lot of potential as a supportable alternative for the industry since it allows recovering citrus by-products. In addition to this study compared a mathematic model based on single plate particle description to predict the behavior of steam explosion and hydro-distillation process.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0140a">M.J.
