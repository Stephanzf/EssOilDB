In recent times, it has been found that the nutrition within the&#x000a0;first 1,000&#x000a0;days from conception is critical because whatever is lost during the first 1,000&#x000a0;days is usually irreplaceable. It is therefore imperative that pregnant women get the best nutrition in whatever form it is available.</p><p>Pregnant women in sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa are at risk of poor nutritional status and adverse outcomes due to poverty, suboptimal healthcare facilities, and infections. Food insecurity also contributes to the risk of poor nutrition among pregnant women in sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa. Studies in Ghana have shown a high prevalence of nutrient deficiencies such as iron, protein, vitamin A, and folate, which is largely due to the unavailability of adequate food sources (Ayensu, Edusei, Oduro, &#x00026; Larbie, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Saaka, Oladele, Larbi, &#x00026; Hoeschle&#x02010;Zeledon, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The effects of poor nutrition among a population cannot be underrated. Documented consequences of maternal protein deficiency include anemia, embryonic losses, intrauterine growth restriction, and reduced postnatal growth. Adequate intake of essential nutrients is therefore necessary for averting undesirable birth outcomes. It would also be important to make the food sources of essential nutrients available in a convenient, cheap, and sustainable manner to enable the populace have easy access to them.</p><p>Animals are known to be a rich source of protein, and livestock production has over the years been a major source of providing the human species with their protein requirements. In recent times, however, there have been concerns with regard to the environmental effects of livestock production. Increasing animal protein production through the traditional livestock rearing is said to lead to an unsustainable rise in greenhouse emissions (Gerber et al., <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Decreasing livestock production on the other hand may be beneficial to the environment but will increase malnutrition incidences, because about 10.7% (815 million) of the world's population currently suffer from chronic undernourishment (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, &#x00026; WHO, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). This prompts the need for more balanced and environmentally friendly methods for producing nutritious foods. The use of insects as food is among the many approaches that have been thought to provide a long&#x02010;lasting solution to this foreseen future deficit in animal protein supply. Other underutilized indigenous crops such as the orange&#x02010;fleshed sweet potato could also provide other nutrients resulting in a balanced diet that pregnant women could rely on to supply their nutritional needs.</p><p>The practice of using insects for food although may be new to some populations, especially in Western countries, has existed for thousands of years and is currently practiced by over 2 billion people in 113 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Beetles, caterpillars, wasps, bees, crickets, grasshoppers, termites, and locusts are common among the over 2000 species of insects known to be consumed by humans (Van Huis et al., <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Insects are highly nutritious and rich sources of essential amino acids just as other forms of protein such as beef, fish, and poultry (Payne, Scarborough, Rayner, &#x00026; Nonaka, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Rumpold &#x00026; Schl&#x000fc;ter, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). For instance, consuming 100&#x000a0;g of caterpillars can provide 76% of the recommended daily protein requirements for adults (Agbidye, Ofuya, &#x00026; Akindele, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In addition to their nutritional benefits, insect production can be advantageous to the environment due to reduced pesticide use and the use of smaller land areas to produce the same quantities of the protein resulting in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and higher efficiency in feed conversion (Oonincx &#x00026; De Boer, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Ribeiro, Cunha, Sousa&#x02010;Pinto, &#x00026; Fonseca, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Unfortunately, most of these benefits are largely unknown to the public leading to the marginalization of entomophagy even in countries where insects are part of traditional cuisines.</p><p>Entomophagy is widespread in Ghana with different insect species being consumed in different regions in the country. The insects commonly consumed in Ghana are termites, shea tree caterpillar, grasshoppers, locust, field cricket, palm weevil larvae and scarab beetle (Anankware, Fening, Osekre, &#x00026; Obeng&#x02010;Ofori, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Among these, the larvae of the African palm weevil (<italic>Rhynchophorus phoenicis Fabricius</italic>), locally known as &#x0201c;Akokono&#x0201d; among the Akans, are the most consumed. The larvae are available all year round in palm&#x02010;growing communities but most abundant during the main rainy season (May to October) (Anankware et al., <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). They are usually roasted, stewed or boiled, and served during storytelling or for special dishes on special occasions. Because of their high protein content, consumption of the larvae is currently being promoted as an alternative source of protein for preventing severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and possibly anemia (Elemo, Elemo, Makinde, &#x00026; Erukainure, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Parker et al., <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).</p><p>Orange&#x02010;fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) is an excellent source of vitamin A and a cheaper source of this vitamin for poor rural and urban families in sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa. It is also rich in energy, vitamin B vitamin, vitamins C and K as well as potassium and phosphorus. Research evidence suggests that daily addition of 100&#x000a0;g of OFSP to the diet can prevent vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in children and reduce maternal mortality. One small boiled root of most varieties of OFSP is known to provide 100% of the daily vitamin A recommendations for children and one medium root provides all of the vitamin A needs for most women of reproductive age (Mitra, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Presently, OFSP is underutilized and rarely consumed in most regions of Ghana probably due to low publicity.</p><p>Despite the enormous nutritional benefits of eating insects and other indigenous food crops, Westernization, in recent times, has affected the attitudes of people negatively regarding their consumption. It will therefore be prudent to adopt the approach of merging the nutrient&#x02010;rich traditional cuisines with popular foods such breads, biscuits, chocolates, and even juices. Biscuits are popular ready&#x02010;to&#x02010;eat convenient and affordable snacks that are widely consumed by all age groups in many countries and have been used for nutrient supplementation in many cases. The principal ingredients for making them are wheat flour, shortening, and sugar. These ingredients result in products that are high in carbohydrate but low protein and micronutrient contents. We therefore developed a supplemental palm weevil larvae and orange&#x02010;fleshed sweet potato biscuit as a snack with the aim of harnessing of the nutritional and health benefits of the palm weevil larvae and orange&#x02010;fleshed sweet potato to help improve the protein and vitamin A intakes of pregnant women in Ghana.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="fsn31024-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Three biscuits, of varying palm weevil larvae composition, made with wheat flour were developed based on the current protein dietary reference intake of 71&#x000a0;g/day or 1.1&#x000a0;g/kg body weight/day for pregnant women. It was estimated that pregnant women would obtain at least 70% of their protein needs from household food sources and the palm weevil larvae and orange&#x02010;fleshed sweet potato&#x02010;enriched biscuits would provide 30% of the remaining needs, whereas the plain wheat biscuits would provide minimal protein. Farmed palm weevil larvae were obtained from the ASPIRE Food Group breeding site, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana. The orange&#x02010;fleshed sweet potato flour and other ingredients were purchased from a local market in Kumasi, Ghana. All reagents used in the analysis were of analytical grade, obtained from Chemolab Supplies, Malaysia. The experiment was carried out in the Food Processing Laboratory, Department of Food Science and Technology, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana, and the Nutrition Laboratory of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia.</p><sec id="fsn31024-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Production of palm weevil larvae (<italic>Rhynchophorus phoenicis</italic> Fabricius) and orange&#x02010;fleshed sweet potato biscuits</title><p>The processes involved in the production of the biscuits are presented in Figure <xref rid="fsn31024-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The palm weevil larvae flour (PWLF) and the orange&#x02010;fleshed sweet potato flour (OFSPF) were mixed with wheat flour in three formulations that had 0%, 35%, and 70% of the larvae before being made into biscuits. The preparation was done using the creaming method described by Okaka (<xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>) with slight modifications. The basic formulations were OFSPF, PWLF, and wheat composite flour, fat (30%), sugar (20%), salt (2%), and baking powder (1%). The sugar and fat were mixed to produce a creamy mixture after which the flour and other dry ingredients were weighed out and added. The mixture was extensively blended to form a hard consistent dough. The dough obtained was kneaded for about 5&#x000a0;min, thinly rolled on a wooden board with a rolling pin until a consistent thickness, and cut out (using a biscuit cutter) to desired shapes of similar sizes. The cutout biscuit dough pieces were then arranged on greased baking trays and placed in an oven to bake at 200&#x000b0;C for 20&#x000a0;min. The biscuits were cooled immediately after baking and packed in polyethylene bag. These were sealed and kept at room temperature until used for chemical analysis and sensory evaluation. The biscuits used as the control were produced using wheat flour (100%) following the same procedure.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="fsn31024-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart for preparation of biscuits enriched with PWL and OFSP</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-3" xlink:href="FSN3-7-1807-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="fsn31024-sec-0004"><label>2.2</label><title>Proximate analysis</title><p>The proximate was carried out according to AOAC (<xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>), and all analysis was carried out in triplicate.</p><sec id="fsn31024-sec-0005"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Determination of moisture content</title><p>The moisture content of the formulated biscuits was determined according to the official methods of analysis (AOAC, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>).

The moisture content of the biscuits ranged from 4.0% to 7.07% decreasing with increasing percentage of PWLF substitution. Biscuits produced from 70% PWLF had the lowest (4.0%) moisture content while the biscuits produced from 100% wheat flour had the highest (7.07%). The shelf life of baked products has direct associations with their moisture content, which is an index of water activity and a measure of stability and susceptibility to microbial contamination. Low moisture content of biscuits between 1% and 5% renders them less perishable, thus suggesting that the biscuits produced from 70% PWLF substitution could be stored for a longer time if packaged and stored in appropriate conditions. The carbohydrate content of the biscuits decreased with an increased proportion of PWLF addition. This was expected as increasing PWLF substitution reduced the amount of wheat flour used. The protein content of the biscuits ranged from 8.01&#x000a0;g to 11.68&#x000a0;g. A progressive increase in the protein content in proportion to the percentage of PWLF added was observed.

It is important to note, however, that the formulations used by Adeboye et al. (<xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and Idolo (<xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) had an additional source of protein being eggs, but this study did not. The difference in protein content could therefore be attributed to this factor. Again, since the nutrient composition of edible insect is influenced by their feed; another reason for the difference in protein content could be that the protein levels of PWL used in the formulation in this study were generally lower than the ones used by Adeboye et al. (<xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and Idolo (<xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, defatted palm weevil larva (dry basis) has been found to have a protein content of 66.3% (Elemo et al., <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). This implies that the protein content of the biscuit developed in this study can be improved by defatting of the larvae used in the production of PWLF. The results of the study indicate that the protein content of the biscuits developed can meet about 16% of the dietary reference intake of protein for pregnant women, which is 71&#x000a0;g, making it a good addition to the diet of pregnant women. The protein quality of food is dependent on its essential amino acid content. An amino acid profile evaluation of palm weevil larvae revealed that it contained isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, histidine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine which are all essential amino acids. Leucine and histidine are known for enhanced growth in infants and young children making the biscuits suitable for infants and young children as well. Also, adding palm weevil larvae flour to wheat flour in snack production would provide the lysine and threonine lacking in the wheat. This could contribute to the reduction of protein&#x02010;related malnutrition cases in many developing countries like Ghana where starchy foods are major staples.</p><p>The fat, fiber, and energy levels increased as PWLF substitution increased. This does not pose a problem because pregnant women need extra calories to support the development of the growing fetus. Palm weevil larvae are known to contain 65% fat, predominantly composed of saturated fats. Caproic acid and arachidic acid were the most abundant fatty acids in all three formulations, contributing between 43.3% and 50% and 36% and 43.5% of total fatty acids, respectively (Table <xref rid="fsn31024-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The biscuits also contained appreciable amounts of caprylic acid (4.8% to 5.5% and docosahexaenoic acid (4.3% to 7.3%). The fats were predominantly saturated (92.5% to 95.5%). Several studies have reported a number of health benefits for medium&#x02010;chain fatty acids (MCFAs) including caproic acid. It was found that consumption of MCFAs resulted in a reduction in fat deposition through enhancement of thermogenesis in rats (Papamandjaris, MacDougall, &#x00026; Jones, 1998). Clinical studies in both healthy and obese human subjects found greater fat oxidation and postprandial energy expenditure after consumption of medium&#x02010;chain fats (St&#x02010;Onge, Peter, &#x00026; Jones, <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="fsn31024-tbl-0002" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Fatty acid profile of biscuits (g/100&#x000a0;g)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fatty Acid</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PB</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RA</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C6:0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.53&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7.30<sup>a</sup>

The high ash, zinc, calcium, and iron contents of the biscuits with the highest PWLF substitution can be attributed to the fact that animal source foods are high in essential micronutrients. Micronutrients are essential for life and for optimal functioning of the body. The formulated product in this study could thus help combat the micronutrient deficiencies which are widespread among pregnant women and children under 5&#x000a0;years globally, Ghana being no exception. Iron, iodine, folate, vitamin A, and zinc deficiencies are the most common and lead to the growth and intellectual impairments, maternal and neonatal complications, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. According to Ekpo and Onigbinde (<xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), the consumption of 100&#x000a0;g of PWL could meet the RDA for iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, and manganese in most developed countries.</p></sec><sec id="fsn31024-sec-0024"><label>3.2</label><title>Microbial quality of biscuits</title><p>It has been reported that insects, in general, can harbor <italic>Salmonella </italic>Spp.,<italic> Campylobacter,</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus </italic>Spp. and fluke foodborne and waterborne pathogens and chemical hazards (Belluco et al., <xref rid="fsn31024-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), and this has raised a lot of concerns about the utilization of edible insects as food.
