The paw volume was measured 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after the carrageenan administration using a plethysmometer (model PM 4500, Borj Sanat Co, Iran). Anti-inflammatory activity was revealed as the inhibition percent of the edema when compared with the control group.

The pellets were sterilized in an autoclave for 30 min at 120 &#x000b0;C under 15 lb pressure. Rats were anesthetized and pellets were subcutaneously implanted in the axilla region of each rat through a single needle incision. Each group was treated daily, for 7 consecutive days with PBFEO (50 and 100 mg/kg), indomethacin (5 mg/kg), and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg), IP. On the eighth day, rats were anesthetized over again; the cotton pellets together with the granuloma tissues were separated surgically and made free from extraneous tissues. The wet pellets were weighed for the purpose of the wet weight, and then dried in an incubator at 60 &#x000b0;C for 18 hr until a constant weight was obtained; after that, the dried pellets were weighed for a second time. The exudates&#x02019; quantity (mg) was calculated by subtracting the constant dry weight of the pellet from the immediate wet weight of the pellet. Dry weight of granuloma was calculated after deducting the weight of the cotton pellet from the constant dry weight of the pellet and taken as an amount of granuloma tissue formation.

In spite of important development in the field of synthetic drugs during recent years, they are found to have many side effects, while plants still hold their own unique place, by the way of having the least side effects. Therefore, a systematic method should be used to find out the efficacy of plants against inflammation and pain so as to use them as herbal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the antinociception and anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil from the fruits of <italic>P. bashagardiana</italic>. It is the first report describing the anti-inflammatory activities of <italic>P. bashagardiana</italic> fruits in acute and chronic inflammation. Carrageenan-induced edema has been usually presented as an acute inflammation model in the experimental animal. It is well known that carrageenan-induced paw edema is regarded by biphasic episode with the involvement of inflammatory mediators. In the first phase (for the duration of the first 2hr after carrageenan injection), chemical mediators such as histamine and serotonin play a role, while in the second phase (3&#x02013; 4 hr after carrageenan injection) kinins and prostaglandins are implicated (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Our results revealed that administration of PBFEO inhibited edema starting after half an hour and during all phases of inflammation, which is possibly inhibition of different aspects and chemical mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins. The inhibitory activity shown by PBFEO during a period of 4 hr in carrageenan-induced inflammation was in some way more efficient than that revealed by the group treated with mefenamic acid as standard drug.</p><p>The cotton-pellet granuloma is a widely used manner for the calculation of chronic anti-inflammatory substances (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The dry weight of the pellet correlates with the amount of granulomatous tissues, the moist weight of the pellets correlates with transuda. Chronic inflammation happens by means of the development of proliferating cells. These cells can be either spread or in granuloma form. PBFEO (100 mg/kg) indicated significant anti-inflammatory activity in cotton pellet induced granuloma and thus found to be effective in chronic inflammatory conditions, which shows its efficacy in inhibiting the increase in the number of fibroblasts and synthesis of collagen and mucopolysaccharides during granuloma tissue formation.</p><p>Heat-induced and formalin-induced pain models were used in the present study in order to assess the anti-nociceptive effect of <italic>P. bashagardiana</italic> fruit essential oil in experimental mice. Formalin test consists of two phases; the first phase (neurogenic pain) is caused by direct chemical stimulation of nociceptive afferent fibers, predominantly C fibers, which can be suppressed by opiates like morphine (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The second phase (inflammatory pain) results from the action of such inflammatory mediators as prostaglandins, serotonin, and bradykinin in peripheral tissues and also from functional changes in the spinal dorsal horn (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The associated effects, observed after using different doses of PBFEO, did not show any significant anti-nociception properties in both phases, compared to the control group. The hot-plate test was also used as a thermal nociception model to define the central anti-nociceptive activity of PBFEO. It did not practically increase the reaction time of animals against the thermal stimulus; even the lowest tested dose induced hyperalgesia. Furthermore, in agreement with the results of the first phase of the formalin test, the essential oil did not display an analgesic effect in contrast to morphine. Thus, it could be concluded that the essential oil does not have anti-nociceptive properties.</p><p>The second phase of the formalin test indicates the effect of the drug on the inflammation process. In the present study, no reduction in pain behaviors was observed. It is assumed that the essential oil of <italic>P. bashagardiana</italic> fruit contains a substance that directly stimulates pain receptors in addition to formalin-induced pain. However, despite the reduction of inflammation in animals, there are painful irritations that make them show different pain behaviors.</p><p>The phytochemical results indicated that the anti-inflammatory effects of PBFEO may be due to its myristicin content. The major constituent of the oil was myristicin (76.1%). It was observed that myristicin comprised more than three-fourths of the oil composition. The anti-inflammatory activity of myristicin has been previously examined on RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid in mice (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and since the results have shown marked anti-inflammatory activity, it could be concluded that the observed activities of the studied oil were related to its high content of myristicin. Lee and Park (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) demonstrated that myristicin could inhibit the production of several inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-10. Since NO is believed to be a major pro-inflammatory mediator related to the bacterial and viral infections, obtained results suggest that the studied myristicin rich essential oil might have anti-inflammatory activity against the pathologic and excessive production of NO in virus-stimulated macrophages and monocytes (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Excessive production of IL-6 often correlates with some inflammatory autoimmune diseases including Crohn&#x02019;s disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). IL-10 has also been implicated in promoting the pathobiology of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and encephalomyelitis (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These results justified the use of <italic>P. bashagardiana</italic> fruits in traditional medicine. Therefore, PBFEO could be a potential candidate as an anti-inflammatory agent in the management of inflammation-based disorders.</p><p>Also, we used formalin and a heat-induced pain model for assessing the anti-nociceptive effect of <italic>P. bashagardiana</italic> essential oil in experimental mice. Our data demonstrated that <italic>PBFEO</italic> did not produce an antinociceptive effect in mice subjected to both the acute thermal (hot plate) and chronic (persistent) formalin pain stimuli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>P. bashagardiana</italic> essential oil has an inflammatory activity against acute and chronic inflammation in rats.
