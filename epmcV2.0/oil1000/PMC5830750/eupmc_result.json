    "The volatile compounds from various parts of Echinops ilicifolius (Compositae) such as flowers, leaves and roots obtained by hydrodistillation (HD) and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) methods were subsequently analysed by GC and GC/MS and compared. Thirty-seven and 20 components of the flower of E. ilicifolius were characterized, representing 99.7% and 100.0% of the total compositions using the HD and HS-SPME methods, respectively. The major constituents of the hydrodistilled oil were identified as linalool (58.6%), geraniol (17.4%), n-dodecane (10.9%) and nerol (5.4%), whereas HS-SPME extract was rich in n-octane (34.0%), n-decane (25.1%), p-cymene (11.1%), γ-terpinene (5.3%) and 1,8-cineole (5.1%). n-Hexadecanoic acid (32.3%), linalool (16.4%) and geraniol (8.3%) were the main components among 43 constituents identified in hydrodistilled extract of the leaf, representing 99.5% of the total components detected, whereas 16 compounds representing 99.9% of the HS-SPME method were identified, among which n-decane (32.6%), p-cymene (14.0%), n-octane (10.3%), limonene (9.2%), γ-terpinene (9.1%), 1,8-cineole (7.9%) and α-pinene (5.9%) were the major ones. Among 23 components comprising 91.2% of the total hydrodistilled oil detected, n-decane (23.1%), n-dodecane (14.5%), silphiperfol-4,7(14)-diene (11.1%), selin-11-en-4-a-ol (9.5%), n-hexadecanoic acid (7.8%) and n-tetradecane (5.3%) were the main constituents in the root of E. ilicifolius, whereas 1,8-cineole (29.0%), n-decane (12.6%), n-octane (12.6%), camphor (12.0%), p-cymene (9.6%) and γ-terpinene (5.9%) were the main components among the 20 constituents characterized in HS-SPME extract, representing 99.9% of the total components detected. The antibacterial activity of the flower, leaf and root oils of E. ilicifolius against six Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was determined using the MIC method. The growth inhibitory zone (mm) was also measured."
