    "The effect of Tragacanth gum (T) coating containing (100, 500, and 1,000 mg/L) Satureja khuzistanica essential oil (S), Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil (Z), and (1,000 mg/L) sodium metabisulfite (M) on mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) enzymatic browning and postharvest quality was examined throughout 16 days of cold storage. Mushroom respiration rate, soluble solids content (SSC), percentage of open caps, and sensory quality as well as factors related to browning such polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), and peroxidase (POD) activities were figured out. The significant decrease in respiration rate, cap opening delay, and SSC enhancement was observed after treating mushrooms with TZ and TS. Moreover, TZ- and TS-treated mushrooms prevented enzymatic browning through inhibiting PPO and POD activities and increasing activity of PAL over the storing term. Additionally, the influence of TZ5 and TS5 (containing 500 mg/L essential oil) coatings was validated by sensory evaluation through protecting the overall quality of button mushrooms over the storage. Thus, Tragacanth coating enriched with essential oils might be an encouraging nomination for improving the modality of button mushroom and expanding its shelf life."
