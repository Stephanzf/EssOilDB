It has a low amount of saturated and a substantial amount of monounsaturated fats with roughly 2:1 mono to polyunsaturated fatty acids [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In general, it contains 61% oleic acid which is classified as a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, 11% &#x003b1;-linolenic acid and 21% linoleic acid which are omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 7% saturated fatty acids [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Canola oil is second to olive oil in oleic acid content and intermediate among other vegetable oils in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). It contains high level of PUFA comparing to olive and palm oil but lower level than corn, soybean, and sunflower oils [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, it contains phytosterols, tocopherols, which are biologically active isomers of vitamin E [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], beta-carotenes and chlorophylls [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Canola oil is extracted by slightly heating the crushed canola seeds dissolved in the hexane solvent or by cold press method [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Finally, it is refined using water precipitation and organic acid to remove gums and free fatty acids, filtering to remove color, and deodorizing using steam distillation [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Refining methods largely remove vitamin E, carotenoids and chlorophylls during bleaching [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and deodorization processes [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Refining process renders canola oil a hydrogenated mess of trans fatty acids and their consumption may lead to heart problems, blood platelet abnormalities, increased cancer risk and free radical damage [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Characterization of any edible oil is therefore very important because the problems related with its quality and adulteration [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] is very common across the world which is determined by its peroxide value, a most traditional and used parameter for measuring its deterioration [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fluorescence spectroscopy, on the other hand, proved itself an on line, quick, non-invasive and reliable tool for the characterization of food [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been used extensively as a fingerprint optical technique for the quality assurance of edible oils [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present article, three types of canola oils have been spectroscopically investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy. It has been found that the commercially available canola oil brands do not contains vitamin E, beta-carotene and chlorophylls, which should be naturally present. In addition, the effect of temperature on the cold pressed canola oil has been investigated to find a safe temperature range for cooking and frying of food.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>First type of canola oil sample was extracted in the laboratory by dissolving crushed canola seeds in hexane solvent (Sigma-Aldrich). Canola seeds were crushed in mortar and pestle. The mixture was left for three days during which seeds dissolved completely in hexane. The mixture was then filtered through Whatman qualitative filter grade-1 (Sigma Aldrich) to get clean canola oil. It was further placed in a glass beaker with open lid at room temperature which varied from 25 to 35 <sup>o</sup>C in summer at Islamabad for a week to evaporate hexane completely. The second type of oil sample was obtained by cold press mechanism in the laboratory. The clean canola seeds were poured in a stainless-steel cylinder which has a hole in the bottom, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g001">Fig 1</xref>. When bolt shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g001">Fig 1</xref> is screwed down, it presses canola seeds slowly to extract oil which is collected in the beaker. The hole is covered with a stainless steel mesh to stop crushed residues coming out from the hole with oil. This extracted canola oil through cold press method may be called virgin oil.</p><fig id="pone.0208640.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0208640.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the cold press oil extraction setup.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0208640.g001"/></fig><p>The third type of canola oil samples were taken from eight commercial canola brands purchased from the local markets of Islamabad, Pakistan.

At the begging of cooking, an appropriate amount of oil, crushed onion, ginger and garlic are poured into a cooking pot which is heated by a gas burner or an electric stove until onion turns light brown. The temperature of mixture was monitored by a K-type thermocouple that measures temperature directly with an accuracy of &#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C. It was found that temperature of mixture in cooking pot remains between 100 and 110 <sup>o</sup>C and it took 5&#x02013;10 minutes to turn whole mixture to light brown. The cooking time may depend upon amount of food stuff and supplied heat. At this stage, a small quantity of water was poured in the pot so that the above described mixture was just immersed, along with appropriate quantities of other food items including green/red chili, tomato, coriander and turmeric are also added. Then the whole mixture was cooked for 5 minutes by tightly fixing the lid of the pressure cooker. After 5 minutes, lid was opened and the mixture was further fried for 5&#x02013;10 minutes until oil got itself separated from the mixture. The temperature of mixture remained around 100&#x000b0;C due to water content. When all mixture got fried, water content reduces which causes the temperature of mixture to increase up to 115&#x000b0;C. Further heating causes the mixture to burning. At this stage when oil got separated itself from the mixture, vegetable or meat are added and cooked. The whole procedure took around 20 minutes where temperature remains between 100 and 115&#x000b0;C.</p><p>By keeping in view the above described cooking method, heated samples of cold pressed canola oil have been prepared by heating them at the following temperatures of 100, 110, 120, 130, 150, 170, 180, 200 and 250&#x000b0;C in the electrical oven, by considering that the smoke point of canola oil is reported at 220&#x02013;230&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and 238&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, a commercial brand-2 has been heated at different temperatures of 100, 150, 200 and 250&#x000b0;C for time duration of 30 minutes to investigate the effect of temperature on the evolution of oxidized products. Sample of vitamin E (Evion capsules, Merck Pvt. Ltd. Pakistan) has been purchased from the local market.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Acquisition of fluorescence spectra</title><p>The fluorescence spectra of all canola oil samples using different exciting wavelengths in the range 280&#x02013;420 nm have been acquired by a spectrofluorometer system FluoroMax-4 (Horiba Scientific, Jobin Yvon inc, USA). The system was controlled by a software fluoroEssence<sup>TM</sup> operating within the Window&#x02019;s environment. A continuous 150 W ozone free xenon arc lamp is used as the excitation source and the photomultiplier (R928P) was used as the detector. Fluorescence spectra of all samples were acquired by pouring samples in a cuvette through right-angle geometry with an acquisition time of 1 sec. Spectroscopic analysis of the emission spectra shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003">Fig 3</xref> put in evidence that the maxima of the emission bands appeared at the two exciting wavelengths of 330 and 410 nm, which were selected as excitation sources for further recording the spectra and statistical analysis. Both selected wavelengths produced maximum spectral information about samples.</p><fig id="pone.0208640.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0208640.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Fluorescence spectra of cold pressed, chemically extracted and commercial brands of canola oil samples using excitation wavelengths in the range 280&#x02013;420 nm.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0208640.g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Preprocessing of fluorescence spectra</title><p>A set of self-written codes in MatLab (MathWorks release 2014a) have been used for pre-processing of all the fluorescence spectra to remove unwanted noise and for the vector normalization. The pre-processed data have been used in producing spectral plots for comparison. A chemometric technique, called principal component analysis (PCA), has been applied on all the spectral data through a built-in routine in MatLab for classification. The principal component analysis (PCA) is the unsupervised chemometric technique that differentiates the samples on the basis of their similarities and differences by plotting them along the orthogonal axes in the form of components called PCs. These PCs are orthogonal vectors, i. e. not corelated to each other. Therefore, when both are plotted against each other as scatter plot, data of both PCs cluster separately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The first type of oil sample, extracted by dissolving crushed canola seeds in hexane in the laboratory will be called chemical method, the second type by pressing canola seeds through the device shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g001">Fig 1</xref> will be called cold pressed, and the third type taken from commercial canola oil brands will be referred as commercial brands in the discussion.</p><p>It is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g002">Fig 2</xref> that all commercial brands bear very light color and are almost transparent, while oil extracted by chemical method bears yellow and by cold press bears yellow greenish color. Visually all types of canola oil samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g002">Fig 2</xref> can be differentiated, but visual inspection cannot ultimately certify the best one. Therefore, in order to evaluate the three types of canola oil samples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g002">Fig 2</xref>, their emission spectra were recorded by using excitation wavelengths from 280&#x02013;420 nm and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003">Fig 3</xref>, which shows that the emission spectra of commercial brand-2 are entirely different from cold pressed and chemically extracted. The spectra displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003">Fig 3A</xref> evidently shows emission bands at 375, 525 and 673 and 725 nm which appeared in canola oil extracted by chemical method. Commercial brand-2 was randomly selected for different experiments described in the text.</p><p>The emission band at 375 nm is assigned to vitamin E [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which evidently shows that its intensity decreases with the increase of excitation wavelength and disappears at &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> of 380 nm. The spectral intensity of emission band at 525 nm, labeled for vitamin E and beta carotenes [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], increases for &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> range320-370 nm approaches maximum for &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> of 370 nm and then decreases and becomes minimum for &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> of 420 nm. The emission bands at 673 and 725 nm, assigned to chlorophyll derivatives present in canola oil [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] which were extracted by cold pressed or chemical method. Their intensity increases with the increase of excitation wavelength from 280 nm and becomes maximum at &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> of 420 nm. Surprisingly, the emission bands at 375, 525, 673 and 725, which have been assigned above were completely absent from the commercial canola brands. However, the emission band centered at 440 nm as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003">Fig 3B</xref> appeared in all commercial brands, represent oxidized products of isomers of vitamin E [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and fatty acids [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The band at 440 nm shifted to longer wavelengths for higher excitation wavelengths and it is also reported for Millard-reaction products [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003">Fig 3C</xref> shows emission spectra of canola oil extracted by cold press and put in evidence four prominent emission bands centered at 370, 520, 673 and 725 nm and their molecular assignments have been discussed earlier. The emission bands at 375 and 525 nm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208640.g003">Fig 3A</xref> for cold pressed canola oil are shifted at 370 and 520 nm in chemically extracted oil. The shifting of spectra may be attributed to matrix effects of oil samples extracted by different methods. However, fluorescence spectra of chlorophylls fluoresce at the same spectral positions as described above. The intensity of emission band centered at 520 nm increases for &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> range 340&#x02013;380 nm, it approaches maximum at &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> of 380 nm and reduces for &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> range 390&#x02013;420 nm and become minimum at &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> of 420 nm. The intensity of emission band at 673 nm increases with the increase of excitation wavelength which means that chlorophylls contents fluoresce more for longer excitation wavelengths and show maximum intensity at &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> of 420 nm.</p><p>To investigate the origin of emission band at 440 nm, different aliquots of commercial brand-2 were heated at temperatures of 100, 150, 200 and 250&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes each.

As reported in the literature, vitamin E fluoresce at 375 and 525 nm [<xref rid="pone.0208640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], this means that the isomers of vitamin E which fluoresce at 440 nm may have different isomers.

It has been found that canola oil extracted by cold press method is rich with fat soluble vitamins, vitamin E, beta carotene and chlorophylls. Similarly, chemically extracted oil possesses almost same molecular composition as that of cold press but the refining processes destroy its nutritional values. Therefore, if chemically extracted oil is not refined through the processes described in the text then the end users can enjoy its natural ingredients. In addition, it seems difficult to find the origin of commercial brands named as canola oil, as their spectra reflect only oxidized products. Furthermore, it has been investigated that the heating of cold pressed canola oil up to 180&#x000b0;C, does not lose most of its valuable ingredients. Therefore, it can be used safely for cooking of foods where usually temperature remains between 100&#x02013;115 <sup>o</sup>C. In addition, present studies suggested that cold pressed canola oil can be used safely without destroying much of its valuable ingredients for frying of egg which needs temperature range 140&#x02013;160&#x000b0;C and deep frying of meat and fish that needs temperature of oil around 180&#x000b0;C.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Mr. Naveed Ahmad is very grateful to National Institute of Lasers and Optronics (NILOP) Islamabad for providing the necessary research facilities.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0208640.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Dupont</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>White</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Heggtveit</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>BE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Grundy</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
