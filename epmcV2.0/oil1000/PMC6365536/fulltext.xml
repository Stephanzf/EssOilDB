Natural products are often used when DEET cannot be afforded or accessed and when consumers choose not to use a synthetic repellent. The essential oils from two newly bred <italic>Nepeta cataria</italic> (catnip) plants representing two different chemotypes and their respective isolated nepetalactone isomers were evaluated as mosquito repellents against <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes that transmit the Zika and Dengue virus in a one choice landing rate inhibition assay. A dose response curve was generated for each treatment and a time course analysis of repellency was performed over 24&#x02009;hours with a <italic>N. cataria</italic> essential oil sample. The results indicate that all essential oil samples and their respective purified nepetalactone isomers were able to achieve greater than 95% repellency. Between two and four hours, the ability to repel more than 95% of the mosquitoes diminished. At the lowest concentrations tested, the nepetalactones and crude essential oil samples were more effective than DEET at reducing the number of mosquito landings.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Mosquitoes vector the deadliest diseases on the planet killing an estimated half a million people annually by Malaria, Yellow fever and the Dengue virus alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recently, a newer threat known as the Zika virus reemerged and is being rapidly spread by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, as well as from a viremic mother to her newborn and by sexual intercourse throughout the western hemisphere, potentially causing neurological disorders and microcephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Mosquitoes seek out hosts in search of a blood meal for reproduction providing an opportunity for the infectious agent to enter the host while feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The common symptoms of all these diseases are rashes, a high fever and chills that all complicate emergency room diagnosis due to the similarities, resulting in a missed or delayed diagnosis that could result in mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Some diseases such as the West Nile virus show very little symptoms and can go undiagnosed until movement loss or neurological illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Disease vectoring mosquitoes cover the world and efforts to control the spread of diseases, identify new repellents and to educate people lowering the risk of infection are currently being implemented on a multinational level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. DDT (1,1&#x02032;-(2,2,2-Trichloroethane-1,1-diyl)bis(4-chlorobenzene)) is a pesticide that was used globally in the past to kill mosquitoes but its usage has been severely curtailed due to its negative environmental impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Educating individuals about mosquito control in regions of the globe where there is a high rate of disease incidence on how to manage mosquito populations has been effective at reducing infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Insect repellents developed by government and private industries are very effective at deterring mosquitoes and protecting the users from contracting these diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. DEET (N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) has been the benchmark of insect repellents since its development for the United States Army to use in tropical regions where there is a high incidence of insect transmitted diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. While DEET is extremely effective, it is not as volatile as other insect repellents and leads to a limited spatial range of repellency for mosquitoes and other insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Whereas another critical concern associated with the consistent use of DEET is its potential toxicity. Studies have shown DEET inhibits human acetyl cholinesterase, modulates G-protein coupled receptors and inhibits ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Numerous publications exist urging caution in its use and claim that DEET is unsuitable for young children and pregnant females, though the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC; Atlanta, GA) still recommends the use of it for vector protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. DEET is also absorbed through the skin at a high rate and special formulations are required to reduce transdermal absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, other reviews suggest that it does not cause adverse health effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The costs of DEET have made it unaffordable to many of those living in regions affected by disease vectoring mosquitoes such as sub-Saharan Africa, China and India. Between the costs, access, and public concern about the dangers of DEET individuals and families could prefer locally sourced natural insect repellants derived from eucalyptus, mints, cloves, basils and neem leaves rather than DEET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">While many regions of the world have access to DEET and other effective insect repellents, natural products still serve as a primary source of repellents in China, India and sub-Saharan Africa where people cannot afford or do not have access to them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Specialty crops have been&#x000a0;cultivated to produce a wide array of insect repellents in these same regions to repel disease-causing insects from natural sources dating back to before the Common Era<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Ethnobotanical resources have led to the identification of plants that can be used to repel insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Volatizing citronella and geraniol from lemongrass oil as well as neem oil are the most common natural sources of mosquito repellents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In 2005, the CDC endorsed para-Menthane-3, 8-diol (PMD), a steam distillate product from the leaves of the Australian lemon-scented gum tree as a mosquito repellent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Insect repellents derived from natural sources such as volatile essential oils have been shown to be efficient at repelling mosquitoes for up to an hour, however these chemicals are not as effective as DEET overall due to their limited duration of acceptable repellency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Natural insect repellent formulations using essential oils from aromatic plants in the Lamiaceae family are sourced from the glandular trichromes on the epidermis of leaves and flowers.

Since the two main chemotypes of the essential oils (CR3, CR9) were not statistically different from one another and DEET at 1.00%, individuals who are in need of an immediately effective insect repellent could use either <italic>N. cataria</italic> essential oil chemotype for protection and for two hours of protection they can use the &#x02018;CR9&#x02019; chemotype of <italic>N. cataria</italic>. The data from the 0.01% treatment in the dose response curve is in contrast to a biting deterrent study in which DEET was shown to be more effective than either of the nepetalactones and can be attributed to the differences in the tests and/or mosquitoes. However, results from the time course assay demonstrate that the CR9 essential oil is as effective as DEET for the first two hours after application in the landing reduction assay. The two isomers were equally effective at repelling mosquitoes so repellents made from these will be effective as long as it has a high enough concentration of either nepetalactone isomer. While the 10.00% solution of the CR9 chemotype is just as effective as DEET for the first 2hrs, a reapplication would be required after that to keep the numbers of landings reduced by 95% or greater. Efforts to increase the effective repellency duration of the catnip essential oils through formulation development should be considered so that the repellent maintains the &#x0003e;95% landing reductions for over 2hrs so reapplication would be less frequent.</p><p id="Par24"><italic>Nepeta</italic> species producing nepetalactones are found throughout in many regions and can be cultivated in additional areas where&#x000a0;their essential oil can be distilled to repel mosquitoes that inhabit the same regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The processing of raw plants to yield essential oils is accomplished using a variety of extraction or distillation technologies including solvent, supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> or water and steam respectively. In rural communities, the same processing technologies now in commercial use that produce a wide range of essential oils can be used to procure the aromatic volatile oils from <italic>N. cataria</italic> in rural regions. These communities can be protected from disease vectoring insects from the plantings of <italic>Nepeta sp</italic>. that contain high amounts nepetalactones in their already established essential oil crop fields. While many catnip and catmint plants produce essential oils and of these many have nepetalactones as a component in their essential oil, overall functional agricultural yields of the total essential oil and/or the concentration of the nepetalactones is low, leading to a commercialization bottleneck. These results are exciting because these two newly developed genetic varieties produce high yields of total essential oil, and of the oil, each are rich in the bioactive nepetalactones overcoming two of the major constraints in developing a new bioactive ingredient, the cost and availability of the raw material. Individuals in rural communities can overcome the costs of purchasing <italic>N. cataria</italic> essential oil by cultivating catnips that are rich in essential oil and nepetalactones and processing the essential oil themselves for protection. In this case, both CR9 and CR3 strains created offer promise to protecting individuals against <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the New Use Agriculture and Natural Plant Products Program and the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station Hatch Project NJ12158 which provided funding for this work.
