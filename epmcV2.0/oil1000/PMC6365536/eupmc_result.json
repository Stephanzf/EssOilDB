    "There is an increased need for improved and affordable insect repellents to reduce transmission of rapidly spreading diseases with high mortality rates. Natural products are often used when DEET cannot be afforded or accessed and when consumers choose not to use a synthetic repellent. The essential oils from two newly bred Nepeta cataria (catnip) plants representing two different chemotypes and their respective isolated nepetalactone isomers were evaluated as mosquito repellents against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit the Zika and Dengue virus in a one choice landing rate inhibition assay. A dose response curve was generated for each treatment and a time course analysis of repellency was performed over 24â€‰hours with a N. cataria essential oil sample. The results indicate that all essential oil samples and their respective purified nepetalactone isomers were able to achieve greater than 95% repellency. Between two and four hours, the ability to repel more than 95% of the mosquitoes diminished. At the lowest concentrations tested, the nepetalactones and crude essential oil samples were more effective than DEET at reducing the number of mosquito landings."
