It was identified as <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic> by its morphological characteristics and standard internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA sequence. Further, the efficacy and possible mechanism of cinnamon essential oil on inhibition of <italic>C. acutatum</italic> were investigated. Results showed that <italic>C. acutatum</italic> was dose-dependently inhibited by cinnamon essential oil. Meanwhile, the mycelial growth and spore germination of <italic>C. acutatum</italic> were completely inhibited at the concentrations of 0.200 &#x003bc;L/mL and 0.175 &#x003bc;L/mL (<italic>v/v</italic>), respectively. Indeed, both minimal inhibitory and minimum fungicidal concentrations of cinnamon essential oil were measured as 0.200 &#x003bc;L/mL. Additionally, the possible antifungal mechanism of cinnamon essential oil on <italic>C. acutatum</italic> was demonstrated. Results showed that the cinnamon essential oil could destroy the cell membrane integrity of <italic>C. acutatum</italic>, and the structure of cell membrane was changed. Indeed, the cell cytoplasm including soluble protein, sugar, and nucleic acid was released, which significantly changed the extracellular conductivity. Results suggested that the cinnamon essential oil exerted great potential to be used as a natural and efficient preservative for kiwifruit postharvest storage, which were helpful for the better understanding of the efficacy and mechanism of cinnamon essential oil on inhibition of pathogens isolated from decayed &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>kiwifruit</kwd><kwd><italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic></kwd><kwd>pathogens</kwd><kwd>cinnamon essential oil</kwd><kwd>antifungal mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="59"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>&#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit (<italic>Actinidia chinensis</italic>) is the first international red-fleshed cultivar in Sichuan of China. Due to its unique flavor and abundant nutrients, such as high levels of vitamin C, anthocyanins, dietary fiber, and amino acids, &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit has interested consumers (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). China is the leading kiwifruit producing country, and the average level of production topped the list in 2013&#x02013;2016 (44.5% of the world production). Kiwifruit is infected by different fungi associated with fruit diseases. For instance, gray mold, caused by <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, is one the important postharvest diseases of kiwifruit (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Williamson et al., 2007</xref>); Blue mold, caused by <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic>, can also cause decay in harvested kiwifruit, although it is not as prevalent as gray mold (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Neri et al., 2010</xref>). Especially, the anthracnose of kiwifruit is severe, which can infect leaves, canes, and fruits, resulting in significantly economic losses during storage. However, at present, relevant studies on anthracnose of kiwifruit have seldom been reported.</p><p>The use of chemically synthetic preservative in controlling food spoilage and pathogenic fungus has been a controversial topic (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2014</xref>). The artificially chemical compounds are considered as chronic and reproductive toxicants causing respiratory diseases or other health risks (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fleming-Jones and Smith, 2003</xref>). In this case, natural preservatives such as essential oil (EO) have been extensively used due to its biodegradable and antimicrobial properties. EO contains a variety of substances called &#x02018;phytochemicals&#x02019;, which belong to natural components in plants (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pratt, 1992</xref>). The phytochemical preparations with dual functionalities in preventing lipid oxidation and antimicrobial properties have tremendous potential for extending shelf life of food products (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fadli et al., 2012</xref>). Generally, EO possesses high volatility. When EO is applied as a vapor, less oil is used. Further, the residues of EO on the product are minimized, and there will be less of a problem with tainting (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Szczerbanik et al., 2007</xref>). It may be more appropriate to use EO in their vapor phase for postharvest applications (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Concha et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zollo et al., 1998</xref>). Cinnamon (<italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> or <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic>), rich in EO, belongs to Lauraceae family comprising about 250 species and usually distributes in India, China, Sri Lanka, and Australia (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2009</xref>). Cinnamon essential oil (CEO) is a promising food preservative for the inhibition of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). Our previous studies have shown that CEO have good efficacy on preservation of &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit. Moreover, &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit fumigated with 0.4 &#x003bc;L/mL of CEO could be stored at (4 &#x000b1; 1) &#x000b0;C with relative humidity of 90&#x02013;95% for 120 days (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2015</xref>). CEO has been demonstrated as a strong and broad range of inhibition for bacteria, fungi and yeast (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Manso et al., 2015</xref>). Our previous studies have demonstrated that CEO have good inhibitory effects against <italic>Botryosphaeria parva in vitro</italic>, and can reduce soft rot on &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2015</xref>). Antifungal activity of CEO against <italic>C. acutatum</italic> isolated from strawberry anthracnose was investigated (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Duduk et al., 2015</xref>). Cell plasma membrane (PM) is the action site invaded by antifungal substances, such as silicon and chlorine dioxide (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). For fungi, the integrity of PM plays a crucial role in maintaining cell constituents being important to viability, such as sugar, protein and nucleic acid. The soluble sugar, soluble protein and nucleic acid are the basic and functional components in the cell. The PM is damaged, and the intracellular components can be leaked (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The antifungal activity of EO was strongly associated with its compositions, such as monoterpenic phenoles, especially thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Barrera-Necha et al., 2008</xref>). The antifungal mechanism of EO is speculated to induce membrane disruption by their lipophilic compounds (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cowan, 1999</xref>). The low-molecular-weight and highly lipophilic components of EO pass easily through cell membranes and cause disruption to the fungal cell organization (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Shukla et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, in this study, the dominant pathogens, which caused postharvest diseases such as anthracnose in &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit, was firstly isolated and identified. Further, the antifungal activity and the possible antifungal mechanism of CEO against <italic>C. acutatum</italic> isolated from decayed &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Materials and Chemicals</title><p>Fresh &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruits grown in Ya&#x02019;an country, Sichuan Province, China, were harvested from orchards.

Then, pieces of kiwifruit sarcocarp about 4 mm<sup>2</sup> were excised from diseased berries with a sterile scalpel from the marginal area between the diseased and healthy tissue. The pieces were incubated on PDA. After isolation, the purified fungi were cultivated on PDA. After incubation at 25&#x000b0;C for 7 days, colonial morphology including micromorphological features, viz., color of colony on both of dorsal and ventral sides, growth diameter and texture of colony, and some microscopic features like mycelial size and conidial shape were measured.

After 4 days, the extracellular conductivity of suspensions with CEO (512 &#x003bc;S/cm and 526 &#x003bc;S/cm) remained at the same level, but the values CEO treated cells were significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) than the control (211 &#x003bc;S/cm and 223 &#x003bc;S/cm) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>). Additionally, the leakage of protein, sugar, and nucleic acid could be considered as important indicators of CM damage. <italic>C. acutatum</italic> cells were treated with the MFC of CEO, and the amounts of released protein, sugar, and nucleic acid were investigated. The results showed that <italic>C. acutatum</italic> cells treated with CEO accumulated more protein, sugar, and nucleic acid than the untreated group (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref></bold>). In this study, protein, sugar, and nucleic acid leakages can be detected in time-dependent tests. In time-dependent killing, protein, sugar and nucleic acid leakages were initially sluggish, and the leakages increased with treatment duration (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref></bold>). At the first 4 days, proteins and sugar leaked markedly in treatment, and the leakage increased slowly after 4 days (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D,E</xref></bold>). However, the leakage of protein and sugar stayed at a very low level for control (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D,E</xref></bold>). Hence, the leakages of treatment groups were significantly higher than that of control. At the first 4 days, the absorbance value for nucleic acid (OD 260 nm) of <italic>C. acutatum</italic> increased significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) from 0.018 to 0.048 (control), and from 0.013 to 1.269 (CEO treatment group), respectively (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref></bold>). After 4 days, the value of OD 260 nm was followed by a steady state, which clearly indicated that the CM integrity of <italic>C. acutatum</italic> had been compromised after exposure to CEO, which could consequently lead to cell death.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The isolated pathogen was inoculated in the surface-sterilized and healthy kiwifruit. The results showed that the sample was attacked after inoculating 24 h at 25&#x000b0;C because of brown dots on the surface of fruit. Then the lesion rapidly expanded and showed drying shrinkage and depression on the 5th day. The color of pericarp turned to dim and pink, and then sticky particulates on pathogenic sites, which were the conidial heaps. Finally, as the decay spread out, the whole of fruit was brown rot and even dried. According to the morphological and molecular identification, the pathogen from &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit was further determined as <italic>C. acutatum.</italic> Previous studies found that <italic>C. musae</italic> occurring anthracnose could cause the development of black circular/ lenticular spots during ripening in banana (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Barrera-Necha et al., 2008</xref>). So far, to best of our knowledge, there were no reports on <italic>C. acutatum</italic> from &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit.</p><p>Essential oil showed a superior antimicrobial activity that the growth of tested organisms was inhibited more efficiently by gaseous contact than by solution contact (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Inouye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Oonmetta-Aree et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, in this study, the antifungal activity of CEO was carried out with its volatile substances, and the antifungal effect was good. The results showed that CEO exhibited antifungal activity against <italic>C. acutatum</italic> as a volatile <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both MIC and MFC of CEO were 0.200 &#x003bc;L/mL. These results confirmed other findings on antifungal activity of CEO against several fungal pathogens including <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic>, <italic>Zygosaccharomyces rouxii</italic> and <italic>Zygosaccharomyces bailii in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Manso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro-Santos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Ribes et al., 2017</xref>). CEO had a strong antifungal effect against <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, with a MIC of 0.05&#x02013;0.10 mg/mL, and a MFC of 0.05&#x02013;0.20 mg/mL (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Manso et al., 2013</xref>). The MIC of CEO against <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> strains and <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> were 0.125 &#x003bc;L/mL and 0.250 &#x003bc;L/mL, respectively (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kocevski et al., 2013</xref>). CEO could effectively inhibit the growth of <italic>Botryosphaeria parva</italic> in the dilution method, and both MIC and MFC of CEO were 0.078 &#x003bc;L/mL (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2015</xref>). Volatiles of CEO obviously affected appressorium formation, while in control treatment germinal spores formed one or more appressoria. Results showed that inhibitory activity of CEO was significantly correlated with the concentration of CEO. In present study, the spore germination was more sensitive to CEO treatment than mycelial growth, which was in accordance with previous studies (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Duduk et al., 2015</xref>). CEO had a fungistatic effect against mycelial growth of <italic>C. acutatum</italic> isolated from strawberry anthracnose at 0.667 &#x003bc;L/mL. Meanwhile, CEO completely prevented the spore germination and appressorium formation at 0.00153 &#x003bc;L/mL (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Duduk et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, CEO strengthens its merits as a post-harvest fungicide against food-borne pathogens. Moreover, the MIC and MFC of CEO against <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. were lower than those of some earlier reported EO viz., <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zambonelli et al., 1996</xref>), clove [<italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (L.)] (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ranasinghe et al., 2002</xref>) and tea tree oil (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Szczerbanik et al., 2007</xref>). These results indicated that CEO had high potential of economic exploitation.</p><p>The potential mechanisms underlying the antifungal activity of plant essential oils are not fully understood, but a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed. The results of TEM indicated that the CEO destroyed not only the CW, but also the PM, by interacting with the structures of cytoplasmic organelles in comparison with untreated samples. The degree of damage had dose-effect relationship, and that destructiveness of 2MFC was stronger than MFC. The CEO showed antifungal activity against <italic>C. acutatum</italic> causing cellular damages and irreversible morphological changes. Previous studies revealed morphological alterations in <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> by TEM observations (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nogueira et al., 2010</xref>). Results showed that a marked disruption of membranes of major organelles such as nuclei, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, indicated that <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> EO passed not only through the CW, but also through the PM and then interacted with membranous structures of the cytoplasmic organelles. Studies also reported irreversible damage to CW, CM and organelles of <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> by <italic>Cinnamomum jensenianum</italic> essential oil (CJEO) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). In the CJEO-treated hyphae, the fibrillar layers had gradually lost their integrity, becoming thinner, and eventually failing to deposit on the CW. In addition, the mitochondria suffered a severe disruption of the internal structure with complete lysis. Indeed, studies demonstrated that the TTO could destruct for organelles of <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> by TEM observation (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). The PM appears to be the main target of the EO according to TEM data. Furthermore, FMS observation showed that the propidium iodide could permeate CM into intracellular cytoplasm while cells were destroyed. Then CEO was responsible for a fungicidal effect, resulting in extensive lesion to the plasmatic membrane, either from a direct effect or as a secondary result of metabolic impairment. Results showed that CEO could be used as a fungicide to damage membrane integrity.</p><p>In order to confirm the CEO targets in the PM, the amount of ergosterol was assessed. Ergosterol is the major sterol component of the fungal CM, helping to maintain cell function and integrity (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Vale-Silva et al., 2010</xref>). It is a sterol with a CM specific of fungi and microalgae with the advantage of indicating only viable biomass, since it is quickly degraded after the cell&#x02019;s death (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gutarowska and Zakowska, 2009</xref>). The correlation between ergosterol and biomass of several fungal species has been confirmed (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies suggested that the PM was the main target of EOs against fungi, and that the oil caused dose-dependent reduction in ergosterol quantity (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Our results supported a model in which cellular membranes were the primary targets for CEO with different concentrations.</p><p>The lipophilicity of EOs enable them to preferentially part from an aqueous phase into membrane structures of the fungi, resulting in expansion of membrane, and then increase of membrane fluidity and permeability, disturbance of membrane-embedded proteins and soluble sugars, and other cellular contents. The electric conductivity was examined to express the changes of CM permeability. Our results showed that the extracellular conductivity rose with the increasing of CEO concentration and treatment time. The results clearly indicated that there was a leakage of electrolytes due to the disruption of cell permeability caused by CEO. Excessive electrolyte loss would cause the death of <italic>C. acutatum.</italic> This slight increase for control might be due to regular fungal cytolysis and death, just as <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Diao et al. (2014)</xref> and <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2016)</xref>. The integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane is a critical factor to fungal growth. Analyzing the leakage of cell constituents could therefore give further insight into the mechanism of antifungal action. The ability of CEO to disturb the integrity of the PM of fungal cells was also assessed by measuring the protein, sugar, and nucleic acid released in cell suspensions. Results showed that the leakage increased with the extension of treatment time.</p><p>The antifungal property of EO may be contributed to its major components. 1, 8-cineole (56%) was the major component in <italic>Callistemon lanceolatus</italic> (Sm.). Sweet essential oil, which showed great inhibitor effect against fungi (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Shukla et al., 2012</xref>). (<italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde was found as the major component in cinnamon leaf volatile oil, which possessed crucial inhibitory activity (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2007</xref>). The compositions of CEO are greatly influenced by the species, part of plant used, geographic origin, time of harvest, stage of development, age of plants and extraction method (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Twenty components in CEO extracted from bark was identified, and twenty-one components of CEO extracted from leaf was identified. The major components of bark EO are methyl cinnamate (81.87%), linalool (3.90%) and &#x003b1;-pinene (2.41%). The major components of leaf volatile oil are linalool (67.60%), methyl cinnamate (17.32%) and &#x003b1;-pinene (2.74%) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Malsawmtluangi et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have validated that the major components of CEO are <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde or cinnamaldehyde (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Go&#x000f1;i et al., 2009</xref>), which were consistent with our results (<bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the content of <italic>trans-</italic>cinnamaldehyde (86.16%) in our study was much higher than that of previous studies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2013</xref>). It remains to be further defined whether major components are the main antifungal composition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results demonstrated that the major pathogen from &#x02018;Hongyang&#x02019; kiwifruit causing to anthracnose was <italic>C. acutatum.</italic> The inhibition of CEO against <italic>C. acutatum</italic> attributed to the reducing of fungal growth and spore germination. CEO could penetrate CW, and pass through the PM, and then interact with the membranous structures of cytoplasmic organelles. Moreover, the major components of CEO such as cinnamaldehyde could be used as a natural fungistat. The antifungal mechanism of cinnamaldehyde requires further investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>JH, WQ, and DW designed the study.
