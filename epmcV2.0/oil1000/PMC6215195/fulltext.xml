The results revealed that chitosan-stabilized AgNPs were nontoxic to normal fibroblasts, even at high concentrations, compared to bare nanoparticles, while significant antibacterial activity was recorded. The silver colloidal dispersion was further mixed with essential oils (EO) to increase the biological activity. Synergistic effects at some AgNP&#x02013;EO ratios were observed, as demonstrated by the fractionary inhibitory concentration values.

Introduction</title><p>Antibiotics have been very effective in controlling bacterial infections in the early part of the last century, thus being considered one of the most important findings in medical practice. Unfortunately, their inappropriate use has rapidly resulted in the appearance of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Since the first infection with methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) was reported in the United Kingdom in 1962, the phenomenon of resistance has worsened, because now there are already bacteria resistant to nearly all available antibiotics [<xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With increasing concerns of microbial infections, there is a growing interest in the development of new, effective antimicrobial agents. The former strategy of combatting resisting microorganisms was based on the development of new antibiotics, but this way has been abandoned by many pharmaceutical companies due to financing and regulatory difficulties, aggravated by the rapidity with which the resistance to newly synthesized antibiotics is developed [<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Nanoparticles with antibacterial properties have been extensively studied during the last decade [<xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with particular interest in the mechanisms of action against the multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria [<xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This has promoted research in the well-known activity of silver ions and silver-based compounds, including silver nanoparticles [<xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Silver is an excellent antimicrobial agent because of its broad-spectrum biocidal activity and limitation of the development of resistant microbial strains [<xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Its antiseptic properties have been known since antiquity. Currently, it is widely used in ionic-silver-releasing materials in medical devices, wound dressings, surgical equipment, personal care products, cosmetics, sporting goods, food and water storage, water filters, foods packaging, and so forth. Topical ointments containing some form of ionic silver are also used in many preservative applications (i.e., burn-associated injuries, eczema, etc.) [<xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Likewise, metallic silver is used in nanoparticulated materials, which naturally dissolve and oxidize in biological media, rendering partially oxidized nanoparticles with chemisorbed ionic silver on their surfaces.</p><p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can be synthesized by different physical and chemical approaches, but these methods are highly reactive and may pose a high threat to the environment [<xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Common methods involve the chemical reduction of silver salts by different reducing agents such as NaBH<sub>4</sub>, sodium citrate, or ascorbic acid [<xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in such chemical processes, the nanoparticles tend to aggregate due to the high surface energy inherent to the synthesis. In all of the methods, a noble metal precursor must be reduced to its metallic form first and then the formed metallic atom cluster must be able to form a stable sol. To inhibit the irreversible coagulation of particles, a stabilizing agent is usually required [<xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Both the stabilizer and the reducing agents used for the preparation might exhibit environmental toxicity [<xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Preparation of AgNPs by green synthesis approaches has advantages over conventional methods involving chemical agents associated with environmental toxicity. Green synthesis methods include mixed-valence polyoxometalates, polysaccharides, Tollens process, irradiation, and biological components. The mixed-valence polyoxometalates method involves the use of polyoxometalate derivatives which act as both a reducing agent for silver ions and a capping agent for the nanoparticles produced [<xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Tollens process involves the reduction of Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sup>2+</sup> by saccharides forming AgNP films with particle sizes from 50&#x02013;200 nm, Ag hydrosols with particles in the order of 20&#x02013;50 nm, and Ag colloid particles of different shapes [<xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. AgNP synthesis by irradiation of Ag<sup>+</sup> ions does not involve a reducing agent and is an appealing procedure [<xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Ecofriendly plant extracts contain proteins and other active components, which act as both reducing and capping agents, and the formation of stable and shape-controlled AgNPs was also reported [<xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Electrochemical synthesis for the fabrication of AgNPs is one of the most used methods, especially for industrial purposes, since it is an ecofriendly, cost-saving, and facile technique to generate localized nanostructures. The possibility of selecting the experimental parameters allows a high degree of control of size and characteristics of the generated nanostructures [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The antibacterial activity of Ag nanoparticles, similar to other metallic nanomaterials, is closely related to size and surface functionalization [<xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Exposure to nanoparticles for medical purposes involves intentional contact or administration; therefore, understanding the properties of nanoparticles and their effect on the body is crucial before clinical use can occur [<xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The most important limitation in the widespread application of Ag nanoparticles in therapy is the public concern regarding their toxicity [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Physical parameters such as surface area, particle size, surface charge, and zeta potential are very important for providing mechanistic details in the uptake, persistence, and biological toxicity of nanoparticles inside living cells [<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Recently, many studies have indicated that environmental factors, such as ionic strength, pH, or ionic type could also induce transformations of AgNPs that are expected to affect their properties [<xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These findings suggest that the toxicology research of nanomaterials should also consider conditions when AgNPs coexist with and without their bioavailable ions [<xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>As a result, various studies have been designed to assess the effect of even low doses of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on bacterial cell membranes [<xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Results on in vivo toxicity of AgNPs have been reported for various living organisms, such as zebrafish [<xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], catfish [<xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], common carp [<xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], <italic>Corbicula fluminea</italic> clam [<xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> worm [<xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and mice [<xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The interaction of metal nanoparticles with nucleic acids is also a hot topic in the field of bioinorganic research, due to the interest in elucidating possible effects of Ag nanoparticles on the synthesis, replication, and structural integrity of DNA and RNA [<xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the mechanism of DNA&#x02013;nanoparticle binding [<xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several bio-organic compounds have been used for Ag nanoparticle surface functionalization, in order to reduce the toxicity by mitigating the interaction with normal living cells [<xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Synergistic or antagonistic effects of Ag nanoparticles with different antibacterial compounds used in the treatment of infections were reported more than 20 years ago against a wide range of bacteria, including certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria [<xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Unfortunately, the lack of suitable experimental design results in many cases in a qualitative, not quantitative approach, and the reported synergistic effect is questionable [<xref rid="B46-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In the last decade, essential oils originating from various plant species have also been investigated for antibacterial properties, as a possible solution to reduce antibiotic use [<xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The combination of essential oils with antibiotics or other antibacterial compounds was found to be effective against most common bacteria and fungi, but studies on the essential oils&#x02013;Ag nanoparticles synergism are limited [<xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we considered the electrochemical method as a simple, fast, and inexpensive technique to produce colloidal silver with suitable size and size distribution. The rational design of novel AgNPs stabilized with biopolymeric compounds was utilized to ensure a stable, nontoxic metallic Ag nanostructure that combined with essential oils could generate an improved antibacterial efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nanomaterials-08-00826"><title>2.

Methods and Instrumentation</title><p>Synthesis of Ag nanoparticles: AgNPs were synthesized using an electrochemical method with a sacrificial anode [<xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The synthesis was adapted for commercially available instruments in order to design an easy scalable and cost-saving method able to be implemented in industry. The used device was a laboratory Colloid Master 1000 model, (Colloidmaster GmbH, Isselburg, Germany), based on &#x0201c;True ppm&#x0201d; technology patented by the company. The instrument operates with automatic settings of time and current intensity applied, in order to produce standardized Ag dispersions at nominal concentrations of 6, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ppm. In the present study, a preliminary experiment was performed on a sample prepared in conditions to obtain a nominal concentration of 6 ppm, in order to confirm the Ag concentration using the inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#x02013;OES), using the instrument Optima 2100 DV ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). A value of 5.83 ppm was found.</p><p>The two silver bars working as electrodes were connected to the voltage source of the instrument and placed in a 250-mL glass beaker. An adequate volume of dispersing fluid (distilled water or stabilizer solution) was added. In the modified synthesis method, solutions of various concentrations of stabilizing agents were used to replace the water. The reaction was performed for a period of time ranging from 1 h to 4 h, at room temperature, in the dark, and without stirring. Samples with various concentrations (10, 25, 50, and 100 ppm) were prepared. Further characterization of products revealed no significant variation in the shape and size of the particles; thus, 25 ppm samples were used for further studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nanomaterials-08-00826"><title>2.3.

The determinations were performed on the AgNPs suspensions (as obtained from synthesis). The same instrument, the Zetasizer Nano ZS ZEN 3600, was used to perform zeta potential measurements, based on the electrophoretic mobility measurement technique of laser doppler velocimetry (LDV).

The fibroblast cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Thermo Fisher, Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) with pH 7.4, containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g sodium bicarbonate, and 1% PSA antibiotic (penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA).

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-nanomaterials-08-00826"><title>3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of Chitosan-Stabilized AgNPs</title><p>Silver nanoparticles were obtained using a facile, ecofriendly procedure based on the electrochemical method in order to avoid the use of harmful reduction reagents. The bare AgNPs were obtained in distilled water as the dispersion media, without any stabilization agent, and were further used as the reference material in the evaluation of the effect of surface functionalization on the interaction with cells.</p><p>Polymers (various types of chitosan) were used for surface functionalization to prevent aggregation and increase the stability of the nanoparticles. The formation of the AgNPs in the reaction medium during the electrochemical synthesis was evidenced by measuring optical properties. Absorption spectra of bare and chitosan-stabilized AgNPs are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00826-f001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>In the spectra recorded for samples of AgNPs prepared in distilled water, both in the presence and absence of polyelectrolytes, absorption peaks at approximately 410 nm are present, corresponding to the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signal of the AgNPs. The SPR absorption band is quite symmetrical and enlarged; the broadening of the signal could be the result of the formation of quasi-spherical particles or a rather large distribution of sizes. Further characterization of the shape and size of the nanoparticles was performed through TEM and DLS methods.</p><p>The morphology of the AgNPs was evaluated from the TEM images. Micrographs for the bare AgNPs prepared in water without stabilization compared to those stabilized with chitosan are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00826-f002">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>In all samples, single metallic nanoparticles were present, together with clusters formed by smaller particles aggregates, embedded in the same polymeric shell when chitosan was used during the preparation.</p><p>As is expected from the electrochemical synthesis, the particles were quasi-spherical in shape and exhibited a high tendency to aggregate in the absence of stabilizing agents.</p><p>The AgNPs prepared using electrochemical methods are known to be more polydisperse compared to those prepared using chemical reduction methods, in which the control of size and polydispersity is more easily achieved through variation of reaction parameters.</p><p>The size and size distribution of the products obtained in various conditions were determined using dynamic light scattering, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00826-f003">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>Various samples of AgNPs prepared in different stages of this work were compared in terms of size and size distribution, considered as critical parameters for antibacterial activity. For example, six colloidal dispersions (50 ppm concentration) prepared in different periods exhibit an average size of 71.2 &#x000b1; 8.8 nm.</p><p>In most of the cases, for the AgNPs synthesized without a stabilizer, a bimodal distribution of size is recorded; a small population of large aggregates of hundreds of nanometers in size could be observed in intensity mode. The stabilization with the polyelectrolyte chitosan (high molecular weight, HMW, or low molecular weight, LMW) was used to prevent the aggregation of particles. No major difference was noticed between the two types of polymers in the stabilization efficiency; changes in size and size distribution of samples were recorded during a period of 4 weeks of storage (data not shown). The AgNPs prepared in polymeric solutions exhibit smaller average size; for example, in the case of dispersions prepared at 25 ppm concentration, particle diameters were 61.9 nm and 65.4 nm for samples obtained in 0.5% and 0.2% chitosan solutions, respectively, compared to the value of 98.2 nm for the sample synthesized in pure water. The polydispersity index (PDI) ranges from 0.205 to 0.398, which is higher than the accepted value of 0.200, but is close to it nevertheless. Considering the specificity of the electrochemical method used in synthesis and the use of chitosan with medium molecular weight on average, the PDI obtained indicates good monodispersity for polymer-stabilized nanoparticles.</p><p>The zeta potential of bare AgNPs was negative (average value &#x02212;11.2 mV). AgNPs stabilized with chitosan exhibited positive zeta potentials, with values larger than 50 mV and up to 75 mV, according to the degree of functionalization. The electrostatic repulsion between particles increases at higher values of zeta potential, and thus results in the improvement of the colloidal stability. The positive value of zeta potential is considered as an advantage in the interaction of the particles with the negatively charged bacterial wall, leading to a better internalization.</p><p>In order to evaluate the influence of the essential oils on the stability of chitosan-coated AgNPs, a short-term stability test was performed. Samples of chitosan-stabilized AgNPs with and without essential oils (20:1 ratio) were kept at room temperature in the dark, and size and size distribution was measured after 3 days using the DLS method (data not shown). No significant changes were recorded for the average size of particles, and the DLS diagram did not present additional signals showing larger aggregates.</p><p>The interaction of AgNPs with the polymer is also evidenced by the modification of the FTIR spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00826-f004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Representative peaks of the polymeric chain could be recognized in the FTIR spectrum of AgNPs prepared in chitosan solution that confirmed the functionalization of the surface of the metallic particles. The signal at approximately 3400 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the pure chitosan spectrum, which corresponds to the &#x02013;OH stretching, is broadened and slightly shifted due to the interaction with the AgNPs. Other specific peaks for chitosan are modified, either by reduction of intensity or shifting. The peak at 1652 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the pure polymer spectrum, assigned to the &#x02013;CONH<sub>2</sub> groups, is significantly reduced in the spectra of AgNP&#x02013;chitosan particles. The major changes in the bands at 1557 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, corresponding to the amino groups of chitosan, shifted to a lower wavelength, suggesting that the mechanism involved in the stabilization of AgNPs with chitosan is based on the interaction of primary &#x02013;NH<sub>2</sub> groups with the nanoparticles&#x02019; surface [<xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nanomaterials-08-00826"><title>3.2. Biocompatibility Assay</title><p>Since the major concern in using metallic nanoparticles for the fabrication of medical and personal care products is the reported toxicity, our approach is to improve the biocompatibility of AgNPs by coating with a polymeric shell. Thus, chitosan was selected to act both as a stabilizer and to decrease the toxicity of the particles. Chitosan is currently recognized as a highly biocompatible polymer, and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for wound dressing applications and for dietary use in some European countries and Japan [<xref rid="B54-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Many papers have reported that the viability of normal cells after exposure to AgNPs decreases in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but no general conclusion could be applied as major differences have been recorded depending on the type of cells, protocol of the experiment, and size and functionalization of the Ag nanoparticles used. The most common use of Ag colloidal dispersions as antibacterial agents is as active compounds in creams, ointments, wound dressings, and hydrogels for topical administration. The normal cells with which the Ag nanoparticles interact in this case are dermal, thus the influence of the AgNPs on the viability of the normal dermal fibroblast cell line CCD-1070 Sk was evaluated as relevant for toxicity assessment.</p><p>Two types of chitosan were used, with high molecular weight (mol wt of 310,000&#x02013;375,000 Da) and low molecular weight (mol wt of 50,000&#x02013;190,000 Da), in order to study the influence of the polymer characteristics on the increase in biocompatibility of AgNPs functionalized with a polyelectrolyte.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00826-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the MTT results are shown for the fibroblasts exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs (from 1 ppm to 10 ppm) stabilized with chitosan, compared to bare particles.</p><p>As expected, unmodified AgNPs produced reduction of the cell viability at concentrations higher than 2 ppm, of up to 86% compared to the control for the 10 ppm concentration. For the AgNPs stabilized with HMW chitosan, when using the 0.2% concentration of the polyelectrolyte, an increase in cellular viability was recorded for the concentration of particles up to 5 ppm. With the increase of the chitosan in the stabilizing solution, better functionalization of AgNPs was expected, leading to superior biocompatibility, as was observed in the results of the MTT assay. No significant changes were recorded in the viability of treated cells compared to the control across the whole range of AgNP concentrations used for HMW chitosan at 1% in the stabilizing solution. Similar results were obtained for the other type of chitosan used (LMW), with lower molecular weight.</p><p>The increase of the biocompatibility is due to both the reduction of the ionic Ag<sup>+</sup> release and to the higher biocompatibility of the chitosan itself. The Ag<sup>+</sup> could be trapped into the polymeric corona through Coulombic interaction with functional groups of the polyelectrolyte macromolecule (especially amino groups) [<xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-08-00826" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00826-f006">Figure 6</xref>, it can be seen that after exposure of the dermal cells to AgNPs, LDH activity did not reveal any significant change in cytotoxicity between treated cells versus control cells at concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 ppm.</p><p>For the cells exposed to bare AgNPs at the 10 ppm concentration, the integrity of the cell membrane was slightly affected, with LDH activity showing the highest increase of 8% compared to the control.</p><p>Taking these data into account, AgNPs stabilized with 1% chitosan could be considered safe for use in further experiments at concentrations up to 10 ppm.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-nanomaterials-08-00826"><title>3.3. Quantitative Assay of the Antimicrobial Activity and Synergistic Effects</title><p>Antibacterial activity of various formulations based on AgNPs was evaluated by using the microdilution method, measuring the OD of the samples via a microplate reader.</p><p>The results for the antimicrobial activity of the new AgNPs stabilized with 1% HMW chitosan, with average size of 62.5 nm, expressed in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against various microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) are presented in <xref rid="nanomaterials-08-00826-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>These results show that the tested AgNPs exhibited a specific antimicrobial activity, depending on the nature of the microorganism, which ranged between 0.78 ppm and 3.13 ppm.</p><p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values are consistent with good antimicrobial activity of the AgNPs against all tested pathogens, taking into account the size of the samples.</p><p>No significant variation was recorded when chitosan-stabilized AgNPs were used compared to the unmodified Ag particles with similar sizes. The chitosan polymer is reported to possess an intrinsic antibacterial activity, but the results have been obtained mainly for chitosan nanoparticles or hydrogels. In our experiments on the inhibition of <italic>E. coli</italic> growth, both types of chitosan used in this study (high molecular weight, HMW, and low molecular weight, LMW) exhibited the same MIC value of 3.125%, which is far larger than the concentration of the polyelectrolyte present as the stabilizer in the AgNP dispersion.</p><p>Nevertheless, a further study to investigate a possible beneficial effect in the case of using higher concentrations of chitosan mixed in the Ag colloidal dispersion was performed.

Conclusions</title><p>In the present work, silver nanoparticles stabilized with various types of chitosan were fabricated by a simple, cost-efficient, environmentally friendly electrochemical method. The obtained nanoparticles were quasi-spherical in shape, with an average size of 65 nm and good monodispersity, as observed in a DLS diagram and TEM images. The FTIR spectra show the presence of the polymeric chain attached to the metallic surface.</p><p>The MTT test on a normal fibroblast cell line revealed that the AgNPs stabilized with both high- and low-molecular-weight chitosan exhibited very low cytotoxicity, as compared with bare nanoparticles. The polymer-stabilized AgNPs demonstrated a significant inhibiting effect on the growth of all bacterial and fungal strains tested, considering the large dimensions of the particles.</p><p>When essential oils from thyme and clove, natural products with known antibacterial properties, were added to the colloidal dispersions, the minimum inhibitory concentration of AgNPs decreased by one or two orders of magnitude.</p><p>A systematic evaluation of the interaction of the obtained AgNPs and essential oils in various ratios was carried out in order to emphasize the appearance of synergistic effects in the antibacterial activity of the mixtures.

A remarkable synergistic effect was present in the chitosan-stabilized AgNP&#x02013;thyme oil mixtures at the 40:1 ratio against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.
