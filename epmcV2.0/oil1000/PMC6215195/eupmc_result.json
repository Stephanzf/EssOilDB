    "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are considered a promising alternative to the use of antibiotics in fighting multidrug-resistant pathogens. However, their use in medical application is hindered by the public concern regarding the toxicity of metallic nanoparticles. In this study, rationally designed AgNP were produced, in order to balance the antibacterial activity and toxicity. A facile, environmentally friendly synthesis was used for the electrochemical fabrication of AgNPs. Chitosan was employed as the capping agent, both for the stabilization and to improve the biocompatibility. Size, morphology, composition, capping layer, and stability of the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized. The in vitro biocompatibility and antimicrobial activities of AgNPs against common Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were evaluated. The results revealed that chitosan-stabilized AgNPs were nontoxic to normal fibroblasts, even at high concentrations, compared to bare nanoparticles, while significant antibacterial activity was recorded. The silver colloidal dispersion was further mixed with essential oils (EO) to increase the biological activity. Synergistic effects at some AgNP‚ÅªEO ratios were observed, as demonstrated by the fractionary inhibitory concentration values. Our results reveal that the synergistic action of both polymer-stabilized AgNPs and essential oils could provide a significant efficiency against a large variety of microorganisms, with minimal side effects."
