Introduction</title><p>In Vietnam, tomato is ranked tenth in terms of crop value, topping at more than 9.7 billion VND in 2005. However, tomato late blight, caused by <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, is a destructive disease that causes heavy decline in tomato production for many years. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam, the late blight caused by <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> has drastically hindered the growth of tomato cultivation area in Vietnam from 2009 to 2012, resulting in a halt in production yield [<xref rid="B1-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Studies on the distribution as well as the effects of the late blight disease have also been conducted very early. According to the assessment of harm caused by late blight in the suburbs of Hanoi in 1965, the average loss of 30&#x02013;70%, at the high level, can cause complete loss of productivity. In recent years, the level of the disease is still high. Severe outbreaks of late blight have been observed in many suburbs in Vietnam [<xref rid="B1-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </p><p>Recently, fungicides of biological origin have been strongly accentuated as it could overcome the inherent limitations of chemical pesticides. In addition, the approach of using antifungal substances extracted from plants was reported to be a promising agent against fungi. Marjoram (<italic>Origanum majorana</italic> L., Lamiaceae) is a perennial species originating in southern Europe. The plant has been widely cultivated and used in cooking as a spice. More importantly, distillates from marjoram are highly valued for its antimicrobial, antifungal and antioxidant activity. In one study, marjoram oil has been tested against various bacterial and fungal species, demonstrating improved effectiveness against <italic>Beneckea natriegens</italic>, <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> and <italic>Moraxella</italic> [<xref rid="B3-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, marjoram oil has been studied extensively in the field of plant disease control, especially against <italic>P. infestans.</italic> It is considered to be a fungicidal alternative to chemically derived drugs [<xref rid="B4-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Besides marjoram essential oil, <italic>P. infestants</italic> was reported to be inhibited by pathogen-induced proteins in previous studies [<xref rid="B5-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the process for utilizing the pathogen is quite complicated and not suitable for excess products. When it comes to combating microbes, the use of essential oils has various advantages. First, since essential oils are of natural origin, it is completely safe for humans and the environment. Second, since essential oils are mixtures of many different compounds, the use of essential oil as an antimicrobial agent could impair the adapted resistance against drugs of microbes in various ways. </p><p>However, essential oil from herbal sources demonstrates many disadvantages including poor stability, solubility, and volatility. One of the approaches to remedy such limitations is the application of nano-encapsulation, which is capable of reducing volatility, improving the stability, water solubility, and efficiency of essential oil-based formulations, while still maintaining therapeutic efficiency of the drug [<xref rid="B7-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Dendrimer is a spherical, branched, nanoscale material that is more prominent than linear polymers. The dendrimer consists of three parts including core, inner branches, and lateral groups. Among dendrimers, polyamidoamine (PAMAM), a group of branched-chain dendrimers, including amine branching and amide bridging, is the most widely used dendrimer due to its amine functional groups (for even-numbered PAMAMs) and carboxylates (for odd-numbered PAMAMs) that help dissolve dendrimer in polar solvent [<xref rid="B12-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These groups are also very active so it is easy to react to create new structurally diverse substances [<xref rid="B14-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One of the important uses of PAMAM G4.0 (polyamidoamine generation 4) is acting as a carrier system for the transport of biological molecules and drugs for the treatment of cancer diseases [<xref rid="B15-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, many studies in using dendrimer in biocide has been proved to be much potential [<xref rid="B17-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, Winnicka and co-workers reported the capability of PAMAM dendrimer in increasing the antifungal activity of clotrimazole against different strains of <italic>Candida</italic> [<xref rid="B19-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Later, Winnicka continued to design a mixture containing PAMAM G2.0 and ketoconazole that also dramatically enhances the antifungal action of the drug [<xref rid="B20-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In another study, Jose and co-workers employed different generation of PAMAM dendrimer (G1.0&#x02013;G3.0) as agents to improve water solubility of amphotericin B drug, thereafter enhancing its antifungal action [<xref rid="B21-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, there are not much reports in combining extracted essential oil with dendrimer as carrier system. </p><p>This study attempted the combination of marjoram essential oil with PAMAM G4.0 to produce the oil/PAMAM G4.0 dendrimer system. The system was then evaluated for preservation efficiency of natural oil functions and tested for antifungal activity against <italic>P. infestans</italic>. The polymer structure and morphology of the PAMAM G4.0 were characterized. TGA analysis and the FT-IR spectrum of PAMAM G4.0 containing this volatile oil were also examined.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-materials-12-01446"><title>2.

Briefly, EDA (20 mL) was added to 150 mL of MA dissolved in methanol. The reaction was in turn kept under stirring for 3 h at 0 &#x000b0;C and then 48 h at room temperature. The removal of impurities and solvent was performed using rotary vacuum evaporator (Strike 300, Lancashire, UK), resulting in the core precursor G0.5. Next, G0.5 was added to EDA solution (130 mL) to obtain PAMA G0.0. The mixture was stirred for 96 h at room temperature, rotated under vacuum using mixed solvent (toluene: methanol is 9:1 v/v).

Antifungal Experiment</title><p>Anti-<italic>Phytophthora infestants</italic> properties of the essential oil, PAMAM G4.0 and the mixture of these two compounds at concentrations of 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 ppm are displayed and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01446-f007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01446-f008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="materials-12-01446-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The combination of PAMAM G4.0 and volatile marjoram exhibits superior antifungal properties compared to the marjoram essential oil and PAMAM G4.0. At the lowest test concentration (500 ppm), PAMAM G4.0 has a diameter of inhibition zone of 6.16 &#x000b1; 0.34 mm. PAMAM G4.0 anti-fungal properties are due to the fact that their surface containing &#x02013;NH<sub>2</sub>&#x02013; positively charged particles which could interact and destroy negatively charged microbial membranes. It is also shown that the antifungal property of the essential oil is minimal, as demonstrated by the very small diameter of inhibition zone of 6.33 &#x000b1; 0.33 mm at 500 ppm concentration and the presence of mycelium around the well. In other words, there are no significant inhibition at both 500 and 1000 ppm of essential oil and PAMAM G4.0, individually. This is contrasted by wells of oil/PAMAM G4.0 at all concentrations, showing recognizable inhibition zones. At higher concentrations of 1000, 2000 and 5000 ppm, the antifungal activity of PAMAM G4.0 and oil, individually, was gradually increased and the strongest activity against <italic>P. infestans</italic> was achieved by the oil/PAMAM G4.0. In other words, oil/PAMAM G4.0 was found to have stronger antifungal ability than that of each individual component. After a series of experiments, it can be concluded that the concentration of oil/PAMAM G4.0 at 500 ppm, which respectively exhibited 10 and 22 times bigger inhibition diameter (9.50 &#x000b1; 0.50 mm) than that of essential oil and PAMAM G4.0 at the same concentration (500 ppm), provided the optimal antifungal result as compared to other combinations of PAMAM G4.0 and oil. At higher concentration (5000 ppm), the synergistic effect seemed to be lost. This could be explained by the reason that not all marjoram essential oil used was successfully mixed with PAMAM G4.0, as revealed in TGA analysis. Due to steric hindrance effect, reduced ability of essential oil to be mixed and combined with PAMAM as the concentration of PAMAM increased. In addition, the diffusion of mixed essential oil from the mixture oil/PAMAM G4.0 out of the well to the agar surface in agar diffusion test could also be restricted with the increasing of PAMAM molecules concentration. Taken together, thanks to the synergy between PAMAM G4.0 and oil, not only the required concentration for each component was reduced significantly, it was also possible to maintain the sufficient result, which is important for reduction of environmental pollution risk.</p><p>As revealed in GC-MS result, marjoram essential oil comprised several components with very different chemical structures, which are mostly hydrophobic and some containing hydrophilic functional group in the structure. We also interpreted that there must be a hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic OH or C=OH groups of some components in the essential oil and NH<sub>2</sub> groups on the surface of PAMAM G4.0. The rest hydrophobic components tended to be entrapped within the large internal cavity of dendrimer, which is a common tendency of hydrophobic substances when being mixed with PAMAM, thus reducing the essential oil volatility. This phenomenon has been reported in many previous studies [<xref rid="B16-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B26-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. With the particle size of less than 500 nm, oil/PAMAM G4.0 (average diameter around 40&#x02013;120 nm) is considered as a sufficiently good material for the penetration of nanocarriers into fungal cells [<xref rid="B22-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, PAMAM G4.0 with large number of positively charged surface &#x02013;NH<sub>2</sub>&#x02013; groups facilitates the interaction and destruction of microbial negatively charged membrane. As a result, oil/PAMAM G4.0 fully interacts with the fungus&#x02019;s cell membrane as well as easily penetrates into the cell layer, thus destroying fungal cells. </p><p>The synergistic effect in antifungal properties between the essential oils and oil/PAMAM G4.0 could be explained by the reduction of the oil volatility when it is mixed with PAMAM G4.0 structure, therefore improving the stability and maintaining the antifungal effectiveness better than essential oil in its free form. Moreover, the extremely poor water solubility of essential oil could also be improved by associating with PAMAM dendrimer, which perhaps due to the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the essential oils and functional groups of PAMAM G4.0. There are numerous literatures that successfully demonstrated the use of dendrimer to enhance the solubilization of hydrophobic molecules [<xref rid="B27-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Many of such studies revealed the capability of PAMAM dendrimer in antifungal activity improvement as consequence of enhanced solubility of poorly soluble substances [<xref rid="B28-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For instance, it was reported that the mixture of PAMAM G2.0 and ketoconazole, which is hydrophobic, was 16 times more potent against <italic>Candida</italic> in comparison with free drug [<xref rid="B19-materials-12-01446" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-materials-12-01446"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, TEM and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR technique were employed to characterize the PAMAM G4.0 material and the marjoram essential oil was analyzed for chemical composition using GC-MS. The two samples and the oil/PAMAM G4.0 were jointly analyzed by FT-IR, showing the successful associating of oil and PAMAM G4.0 dendrimer. The resulting PAMAM G4.0@oil was shown to be more effective in terms of antifungal activity compared with PAMAM G4.0 and marjoram volatile oil with same concentration. The enhanced anti-microbial property of the oil/PAMAM G4.0 could be due to the restricted evaporation of the essential oil, caused by the encapsulation. These results suggest that the association of marjoram oil with PAMAM G4.0s is promising in combating late blight in tomatoes and that later studies should focus on determining the suitable concentration for optimal inhibition and conducting field trials.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Investigation, L.G.B., T.L.H., N.T.N.; Writing-Original Draft Preparation, V.M.T.; Supervision, T.T.H.T. and L.M.B.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no external funding.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-materials-12-01446"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Genova</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinberger</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chanthasombath</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Inthalungdsee</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanatem</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Somsak</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><source>Postharvest Loss in the Supply Chain for Vegetables: The Case of Tomato, Yardlong Bean, Cucumber and Chili in Lao PDR</source><publisher-name>AVRDC</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Shanhau, Taiwan</publisher-loc><year>2006</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2-materials-12-01446"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thanh</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tarn</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanh</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuyen</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Srinivasan</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>S.-Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>K.-S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Biological Control of Soilborne Diseases on Tomato, Potato and Black Pepper by Selected PGPR in the Greenhouse and Field in Vietnam</article-title><source>Plant Pathol.
