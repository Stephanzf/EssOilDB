    "OBJECTIVE:This study was to evaluate effects of mixed plant oils (identified as mixed oil 1 [MO1] and mixed oil 2 [MO2]) on performance, serum composition, viscera percentages, meat quality, and fatty acid deposition of broilers. METHODS:A total of 126 one-day-old Arbor Acres male broiler chicks (weighing 44.91±0.92 g) were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatments with 7 replicate pens per treatment (6 broilers per pen). Dietary treatments included a corn-soybean basal diet supplemented with 3% soybean oil (CTR), basal diet with 3% MO1 (a mixture of 15% corn oil, 10% coconut oil, 15% linseed oil, 20% palm oil, 15% peanut oil and 25% soybean oil; MO1), or basal diet with 3% MO2 (a combination of 50% MO1 and 50% extruded corn; MO2). The trial consisted of phase 1 (d 1 to 21) and phase 2 (d 22 to 42). RESULTS:Compared to CTR, broilers fed MO (MO1 or MO2) had greater (p<0.05) average daily gain in phase 1, 2, and overall (d 1 to 42), redness in thigh muscle, concentrations of serum glucose, serum albumin, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio in breast muscle, while these broilers also showed lower (p≤0.05) drip loss and concentrations of C18:3n-3 and PUFA/SFA ratio in breast muscle. Broilers fed MO2 had higher (p<0.05) liver percentage, while broilers fed MO1 had lower (p≤0.05) feed conversion ratio in phase 1 and increased (p<0.05) contents of C18:2n-6, C20:5n-3, C22:6n-3, and n-3 PUFA in breast muscle compared to CTR. CONCLUSION:Mixed plant oils had positive effects on performance, serum parameters, meat quality, liver percentage and fatty acid deposition in broilers, which indicates they can be used as better dietary energy feedstocks than soybean oil alone."
