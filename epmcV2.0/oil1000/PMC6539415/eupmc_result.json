    "A novel recombinant strain has been constructed for converting glycerol into a specific conjugated linoleic acid isomer (trans-10, cis-12 CLA) using Yarrowia lipolytica as host. The lipid accumulation pathway was modified for increasing lipid content. Overexpression of the diacylglycerol transferase (DGA1) gene improved the intracellular lipid yield by approximately 45% as compared to the original strain. The corresponding intracellular lipid yield of recombinant strain WXYL037 reached 52.2% of the cell dry weight. In combination with integration of Δ12 desaturase from Mortierella alpina (MA12D) and DGA1, the linoleic acid (LA) production content reached 0.88 g/L, which was 2-fold that of the original strain. Furthermore, with overexpressed DGA1, MA12D and Propionibacterium acnes isomerase (PAI), the titer of trans-10, cis-12 CLA in WXYL037 reached 110.6 mg/L after 72 h of shake flask culture, representing a 201.8% improvement when compared with that attained in the WXYL030 strain, which manifested overexpressed PAI. With optimal medium, the maximum CLA content and lipid yield of Y. lipolytica Po1g were 132.6 mg/L and 2.58 g/L, respectively. This is the first report of the production of trans-10, cis-12 CLA by the oleaginous yeast Y. lipolytica using glycerol as the sole carbon source through expression of DGA1 combined with MA12D and PAI."
