    "The essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from the stem, leaf and flower of Phlomis aucheri Boiss., which is endemic to Iran, stem, leaf and root of Teucrium polium L. and solvent free microwave extraction oil from leaf of Ajuga chamaecistus Ging. Subsp chamaecistus were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Germacrene D (11.10%, 28.31% and 21. 06%) was the main constituent in the stem, leaf, and flower oils of P. aucheri, respectively. The other main component in the stem oil of the plant was (E) - anethole (24.58%) and in the flower oil was β- caryophyllene (15.93%). All three oils were rich in regard to sesquiterpenes. The main components in the stem, leaf and root of T. polium were α- muurolol (25.02%, 20.03% and 19.53%), α- cadinol (15.72%, 8.11% and 13.01%) and β-cayophyllene (10.86%, 10.11% and 10.64%) respectively. All three oils were rich in regard to sesquiterpenes. The major components in the leaf oil of A.chamaecistus were (z)-β-ocimene (12.11%) and germacrene D (10.11%). The oil of the plant was rich in regard to both monoterpens and sesquiter penes."
