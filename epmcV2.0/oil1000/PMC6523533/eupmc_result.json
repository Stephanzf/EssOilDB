    "The ultimate goal in tissue engineering is to fabricate a scaffold which could mimic the native tissue structure. In this work, the physicochemical and biocompatibility properties of electrospun composites based on polyurethane (PU) with added pepper mint (PM) oil and copper sulphate (CuSO₄) were investigated. Field Emission Electron microscope (FESEM) study depicted the increase in mean fiber diameter for PU/PM and decrease in fiber diameter for PU/PM/CuSO₄ compared to the pristine PU. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed the formation of a hydrogen bond for the fabricated composites as identified by an alteration in PU peak intensity. Contact angle analysis presented the hydrophobic nature of pristine PU and PU/PM while the PU/PM/CuSO₄ showed hydrophilic behavior. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed the increase in the surface roughness for the PU/PM while PU/PM/CuSO₄ showed a decrease in surface roughness compared to the pristine PU. Blood compatibility studies showed improved blood clotting time and less toxic behavior for the developed composites than the pristine PU. Finally, the cell viability of the fabricated composite was higher than the pristine PU as indicated in the MTS assay. Hence, the fabricated wound dressing composite based on PU with added PM and CuSO₄ rendered a better physicochemical and biocompatible nature, making it suitable for wound healing applications."
