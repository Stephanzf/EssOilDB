Extraction of samples with an organic solvent and analysis by fluorescence spectrometry has been shown to be a rapid and effective screening technique for petroleum in the environment. During experiments, rapid analysis of oil by fluorescence provides the opportunity for researchers to modify the experimental conditions in real time. Estimated Oil Equivalents (EOE) relies on the fluorescence measurement of the aromatic compounds to estimate the oil concentration.</p><p>The present intercalibration study was designed to investigate whether different fluorometer instruments can reliably measure EOE and whether the results are intercomparable. Additionally, the need for extraction of oil compounds into an organic solvent was investigated. Three different fluorometers were used in three different laboratories: a Horiba Aqualog, a Turner Trilogy and a Shimadzu Spectrofluorophotometer RF-1501. Results from these different instruments showed excellent agreement for EOE determinations. A very high correlation was found between the EOE results obtained with Aqualog Horiba and Turner Trilogy (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9999), with no significant differences between the mean EOE results (t-test, p = 0.30), and the Aqualog Horiba and Shimadzu (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.995) fluorometers, with no statistically difference between the EOE results obtained by the two instruments (p = 0.40).</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Earth sciences</kwd><kwd>Environmental science</kwd><kwd>Geochemistry</kwd><kwd>Geoscience</kwd><kwd>Hydrology</kwd><kwd>Natural hazards</kwd><kwd>Oceanography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">A large research effort in the aftermath of the spill from the Macondo 252 well resulted in a number of journal articles that studied the fate and the effects of the oil under natural and laboratory conditions. Laboratory experiments and field studies were conducted at different levels of organization (molecular, individual, community, etc.) and on different scales (mL's to 100's of liters). One challenge which frequently plagues laboratory studies is the use of experimental conditions that are realistic and relevant to conditions in the field (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aurand and Coelho, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Sandoval et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Continued monitoring of oil concentrations during an experiment are often a prerequisites to ensuring relevant oil concentrations.</p><p id="p0015">Detailed analyses of oil, which rapidly changes composition due to different weathering processes, are, for example, carried out by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Overton et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Wade et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) and GC/GC/MS (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Hall et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). These GC/MS or GC/MS/MS methods are essential for the characterization of the components of oils but are not rapid, as they require extraction with a solvent, chromatographic clean up techniques to remove interferences, and analyses using expensive instruments. Many experiments are conducted over short time periods (a few days at the most), and oil analysis using GC-MS makes it very difficult to provide the immediate feedback that allows the modifications of experimental conditions in real-time (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Knap et&#x000a0;al., 1983</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">A common alternative to the use of GC-MS is to use fluorescence, a quicker and less expensive method to estimate oil concentrations in near real time, but these techniques provide no detail on oil composition. A basic fluorescence method was developed in the 1980's for MARPOLMON: Marine Pollution Monitoring of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission as IOC Manuals and Guides 13 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">IOC, 1981</xref>: <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">IOC, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Knap et&#x000a0;al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Wade et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Historically, fluorescence and GC/MS analyses provided comparable concentration results (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ehrhardt and Knap, 1989</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">To replicate field conditions below the oil-slick at the surface, during experiments, it is common to use the water-accommodated fraction of oil (WAF) as the exposure medium (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Knap et&#x000a0;al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wade et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). WAF replicates the physical state (dissolved, dispersed oil droplets) of the oil-water system under the sea surface during a spill. In order to mimic the application of dispersant to an oil slick, and the consequent increase of oil droplets abundance in the underlying water, chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) is used. Different procedures to produce WAF and CEWAF have been published, and standardized procedures to produce WAF and CEWAF with different chemical characteristics are available, though these are dependent on the type of oil and dispersant (e.g. <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wade et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). WAF, if made under high energy (mixing) contains dispersed droplets of oil in addition to dissolved hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p0030">If WAF is made with natural, unfiltered seawater, the presence of plankton, bacteria, and detritus complicates oil determinations. The presence of particles and droplets complicates fluorescence measurements, because particles and droplets create a heterogeneous medium that obstructs the light paths in the fluorescence cell. A simple solution to this problem is the use of organic extracts. The fluorescent method mentioned above (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">IOC, 1984</xref>) has been standardized via a single polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, chrysene, a four-benzene ring PAH to make measurements comparable world-wide (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Knap et&#x000a0;al., 1986</xref>). However, mixtures of PAHs or real oil samples are better standards for fluorescence analysis (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Mason, 1987</xref>). Estimated oil equivalents (EOE) measurements are a very good surrogate for oil concentrations if calibrated with the correct oil (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Wade et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). EOE concentrations also have a linear relationships with oil toxicity (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bera et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), and are very good surrogates of PAH analysis done by GC-MS, if the correct standards (i.e. spilled oil samples) are used (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burns, 1993</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">The Aggregation and Degradation of Dispersants and Oil by Microbial Exopolymers (ADDOMEx) consortium was funded by the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI) to investigate the mechanism of marine oil snow formation (MOS), as it was discovered that marine snow was an effective transport vehicle for oil to the seafloor (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Larson et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Passow and Ziervogel, 2016</xref>). In order to understand the processes and mechanisms that may lead to the formation of MOS (see <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Quigg et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) for review), the ADDOMEx team conducted a diverse series of experiments. As different experimental methods were ranging from large (&#x0003e;100 L) glass mesocosms (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wade et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) to roller tables (6 L) (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Passow et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) to bottle experiments (1 L and smaller) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bretherton et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), the consortium needed a method to reliably determine the concentration of oil in different laboratories. Thus, an inter-laboratory inter-comparison exercise was designed and performed with the goals to 1) develop a method that allows EOE measurement using the different fluorometers and 2) ensure that these EOE measurements were inter-comparable.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Experimental design</title><p id="p0040">A total of three intercalibration exercises were conducted. The first experiment was in association with a mesocosm experiment (mesocosm I). The production of WAF for the mesocosms study is described in <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wade et&#x000a0;al. (2017)</xref>. In summary, 24 mL Macondo surrogate oil was mixed with 130 L of seawater in a Baffled Recirculating Tank (BRT) and mixed for 14 hours before WAF was transferred to the mesocosm tanks. CEWAF was prepared with the same procedure except that Corexit (dispersant) was premixed with oil at a ratio of 1:20 (V/V) before addition to the BRT. Samples for the intercalibration were collected immediately after WAF and CEWAF production and measured directly i.e. without extraction. A second set of measurements were done on the same source water samples but this time, samples were extracted with dichloromethane (20 mL water sample extracted with 20 mL dichloromethane). The comparison was meant to determine if extraction of samples before fluorescence measurements was a necessary step. A total of eight unextracted and eight extracted samples were measured, each including four oil calibration standards, two replicates of the WAF and two replicates of CEWAF. The fluorescence emissions of each of these samples was measured on all three instruments; a Horiba Aqualog-UV-800, a Turner Trilogy, and a Shimadzu Spectrofluorophotometer RF-1501 (see below).</p><p id="p0045">A second set of intercalibration samples (exercise 2) were prepared by making WAF and CEWAF in deionized water (DI) as well as in freshly collected natural seawater from the Gulf of Mexico. WAFs were made with 0.4&#x02013;4 mL of Macondo Surrogate oil added to 1.8 L of water in a 2 L aspirator bottle and mixed at 300 rpm for 24 hours (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bera et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). CEWAFs were made in a similar process except that Corexit (dispersant) was premixed with Macondo oil at a ratio of 1:20 (V/V). Two concentrations of WAF (WAF1 and WAF2) each in triplicates, and two concentrations of CEWAF (CEWAF1 and CEWAF2) in triplicate each were prepared in DI. One concentration of WAF (WAF3 with triplicates) and one concentration of CEWAF (CEWAF3 with triplicates) were prepared in seawater. All samples were extracted with dichloromethane (10 mL water sample extracted with 10 mL dichloromethane). This second intercalibration exercise was run as a blind test, meaning the nature of the samples were not known to the people measuring the samples. Only the Horiba Aqualog and Turner Trilogy participated in this second intercalibration exercise. Samples were measured immediately after extraction on the Horiba Aqualog whereas extracted samples were shipped overnight, and measured within a week in the Turner Trilogy. A calibration curve with Macondo Oil (MC 252) extracted in dichloromethane was also prepared on each instrument and used to convert the relative fluorescence units (RFU) of each instrument into EOE oil concentrations. The seven calibration points ranged from 0.1 mg/L to 10 mg/L of oil.</p><p id="p0050">A third set of intercalibration samples were collected during another mesocosm study (mesocosm VI). WAF and CEWAF samples were prepared in the BRT as in the first experiment and a total of ten samples (5 WAF and 5 CEWAF) were measured in both, the Horiba Aqualog and Shimadzu. In this mesocosm study, five replicate WAF and five replicate CEWAF mesocosms were set up and EOE in each measured by both instruments. Five mL of the samples were diluted with 5, 10 or 15 mL dichloromethane to extract the oil before measurement. A calibration curve (see above) was prepared and used to convert fluorescence units to EOE concentrations.</p><p id="p0055">An additional experiment investigated the effectiveness of Corexit to disperse oil when applied in freshwater conditions. EOE of a 1 ppm solution of the single aromatic hydrocarbon, phenanthrene, prepared in both, DI and natural seawater, to which 30 &#x003bc;L of Corexit (dispersant) was added, was measured on the Horiba Aqualog fluorometer.</p><p id="p0060">Association between variables was tested using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, and differences in means between pairs of instruments were tested using a paired &#x0201c;t&#x0201d; test.

By subtracting the &#x0201c;EOE&#x0201d; of the control mesocosm or blank, measured EOE were corrected for such interferences.

Presumably, the improved results were due to the extraction with DCM, which combines both particulate (droplets) and dissolved oil in a solution eliminating problems caused by oil droplets and particles in a fluorometer cuvette.

Various organic solvents have been used, but DCM has been shown to be a better solvent than hexane in the presence of particulate material (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Law et&#x000a0;al., 1987</xref>). Extracts in DCM are normally homogenous solutions, and light scattering by particles including microbes is not a problem. Extraction with DCM works efficiently for most types of the water and sediment environmental samples. However, extraction (DCM) of samples with high organic matter content (including Corexit) or samples from wastewater treatment plant can cause emulsion problems during extraction. For small volume samples (1&#x02013;4 L), repeated (3&#x02013;4 times) extraction with DCM, adding salt to the water and filtering the extract through sodium sulphate generally works.

Measured EOE concentrations in CEWAF made in deionized water (zero salinity) did not lead to increased dispersion of oil (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Addition of Corexit (dispersant) to oil was expected to disperse the oil, forming more, smaller droplets and also increase the dissolved concentration of oil. The solutions of WAF1 and CEWAF1 were both made with DI and contained the same amount of oil. The measured EOE value for CEWAF1 (0.97 mg/L) was only slightly higher than that for WAF1 (0.47 mg/L), indicating very limited dispersion of oil into the water. The CEWAF3 solution, made in natural seawater with the same amount of oil as WAF1 and CEWAF1, had much higher EOE values (32.88 mg/L), confirming that in seawater Corexit (dispersant) is very effective in dispersing oil. An additional experiment with a single hydrocarbon (phenanthrene), where 30 &#x003bc;L of Corexit (dispersant) was added to a 1 ppm phenanthrene solution in DI or seawater, also confirmed that dispersability of Corexit (dispersant) is greatly reduced in fresh water.

This method loses reliability if water samples are analyzed directly, rather than extracted, because of increased light scattering due to of oil droplets and other particles such micro-organisms (phytoplankton and bacteria). Extraction in dichloromethane eliminates these problems and provides vey comparable results using different instruments. The strength of the method are that it is rapid, easy and cheap. Even a small Turner Triology instrument can give reliable results. EOE fluorescence provides a good screening technique with good inter-comparability. The use of this technique for rapid feedback during experiments, where the oil added is known and can be used for the calibration is especially useful. Overall, this study shows that EOE is a quick and reliable estimation oil concentration in water samples and can be easily measured by different spectrofluorometer in most laboratories.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0120">Gopal Bera: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0125">Gerardo Gold-Bouchot: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0130">Uta Passow: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0135">Terry L.
