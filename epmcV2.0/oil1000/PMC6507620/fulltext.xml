TAL (MW 363.49) is a moderately lipophilic molecule (log P: 3.2) with ionizable groups (pKa: 9.4). The solubility of TAL is pH dependent with low solubility at higher pH (0.02 mg/ml at pH 7.4, 37&#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Trausch et al., 1995a</xref>). It has moderate lipophilic properties compared with other &#x003b2;-blockers (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Trausch et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2010</xref>). The commercial product of TAL (Cordanum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) has been frequently used in Germany and Eastern Europe for almost five decades for the treatment of anxiety, hypertension, angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, glaucoma, and migraine headaches with oral doses of 50 to 300 mg per day (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wetterich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chiou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Awadallah et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structure of talinolol (TAL, M.W: 363.5, pKa: 9.4).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fphar-10-00459-g001"/></fig><p>Talinolol has a variable oral bioavailability of 36 to 69% in humans with physicochemical properties suitable for lipid-based self-nanoemulsifying formulations (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Terhaag et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Trausch et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Elgart et al., 2013</xref>). The reduced and variable bioavailability may be attributed to precipitation of TAL in the gastro intestinal tract (GIT), incomplete and erratic absorption, and P-gp mediated efflux transport in the intestine (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gramatte et al., 1996</xref>). It is essential to reduce the precipitation and maintain TAL solubilized in GIT to ensure its absorption in to the systemic circulation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mohsin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ghai and Sinha, 2012</xref>). Solubility and dissolution is primarily the rate limiting factors for oral bioavailability of many drugs. There have been a variety of formulation strategies designed over the past two decades to improve drug solubility to enhance the rate and extent of drug absorption from the GIT (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Shahba et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Devraj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Mohsin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems which belongs to lipid based formulations (LBFs), have shown to improve the slow and incomplete drug dissolution, and facilitate the formation of the highly solubilized phase of drug for enhanced drug absorption. Also, the self-emulsifying formulations can be easily filled in soft and hard gelatin capsules due to their anhydrous nature (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Pouton, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Strickley, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Self-emulsifying formulations are isotropic mixtures of an active drug compound in a combination of lipids, surfactants, and water soluble co-solvents that produce ultrafine emulsions upon gentle agitation in aqueous phase, such as the upper GI lumen content (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fatouros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kale and Patravale, 2008</xref>). Generally, self-emulsifying formulations are categorized as self-emulsifying (SEDDS), self-microemulsifying (SMEDDS) and self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDSs). SEDDS, SMEDDS, and SNEDDS can be differentiated basically according to their size of globules upon aqueous dispersion (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Pouton, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Pouton and Porter, 2008</xref>). A lipid formulation classification system (LFCS) based on the composition was developed which categorized the LBF into four different types (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Pouton, 2000</xref>). The LFCS explains the formation of different types of self-emulsifying formulations in a very simple way based on their types and compositions. Briefly, Type I formulations represent 100% pure oil (surfactant free) as component. Types II and IIIA systems contain water insoluble surfactants (HLB &#x0003c; 10) with different % oil in the formulation (Type II contain 60&#x02013;80% oil and Type IIIA contain 40&#x02013;60% oil). Type IIIB formulations contain water soluble surfactant and oil (20&#x02013;50% oil), whereas Type IV formulations contain only water soluble surfactant/cosolvent without oil. In board terms, the Type II and/or Type IIIA formulations spontaneously forms SEDDS emulsions (translucent) with a droplet size ranging from 250 nm to 1.0 &#x003bc;m. SMEDDS refers to the formulations which form transparent microemulsions (oil-in-water/water-in-oil) with a particle diameter of 50 nm or less, belong to Type IIIB and or Type IV. On the other hand, SNEDDS is a relatively newer term representing the droplet size between 20 and 200 nm, provides also transparent appearance. The drug encapsulated as liquid dosage forms can be in a thermodynamically and kinetically stable form as SNEDDS (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Elgart et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems is an efficient, elegant, and more patient compliant formulation approach for poorly water soluble drugs. It may enhance drug solubility, dissolution behavior in the GIT, gut permeability and thus may increase the absorption of the poorly water soluble model drug, TAL (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Elgart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Shakeel et al., 2016</xref>). The purpose of the current study was to enhance bioavailability of TAL by designing suitable SNEDDS formulations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Talinolol (purity &#x0003e; 99.2%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, United States).

For self-emulsifying efficiency, visual assessment method initially is able to minimize the excess usage of chemicals. The visual assessment was observed/recorded immediately after preparation and for several months for each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Droplet Size, Polydispersity Index (PDI), and Zeta Potential Values</title><p>The droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI) and the zeta potential (surface charge) of all the representative diluted &#x0201c;F&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;AF&#x0201d; systems were measured by a laser light diffraction analysis technique using Zetasizer Nano (Model ZEN3600, Malvern, United Kingdom) particle sizing systems. The formulations were diluted at a ratio of 1:1000 <italic>v/v</italic> with water and mixed well for 1 min.

A drop of diluted sample was placed on 300 mesh carbon coated copper grid (Ted pella). Grid was left for 5 min to settle down the droplets. Excess of liquid was removed using filter paper and grid was left to air dry. Then a drop of 1% phosphotungustic acid in water was added to the grid. Phosphotungustic acid works as negative stain. Again this left for 5 min to settle down and dried as previous. Finally, dried grid was visualized under Jeol TEM, JEM1010 (Japan) at an operating voltage of 80 kV.

The solubility of TAL in the formulations was determined using the common shake flask method. Samples were prepared by adding an excess amount of TAL to the formulations followed by subsequent shaking with the vortex mixer for 3 min at room temperature (25 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C) to ensure adequate mixing. After incubation in a dry heat incubator at 37&#x000b0;C for 7-days period; the samples were removed for solubility determinations. The samples were placed in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes and centrifuged (at 13000 rpm for 10 min) to separate excess solid drug from the dissolved drug. Then, an aliquot of the supernatant was taken by weight (approximately 50 mg) and diluted in 25 ml of acetonitrile. The amount of TAL solubilized was analyzed using a validated (UHPLC) method developed in our laboratory. Three replicate samples were considered for analysis of each formulation system.</p></sec><sec><title>Diluted formulations (99% or 100 times&#x02019; dilution)</title><p>An effective way to estimate the likely fate of the drug upon dispersion or dilution with water is to examine its solubility in the maximum diluted formulation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Mohsin and Alanazi, 2012</xref>). By this method one can predict how much TAL can be loaded in the anhydrous formulation and intended dose to be diluted in the average volume of gastric fluids. The 99% diluted formulations were prepared using water as diluent, each 1 mL of the anhydrous formulation (without any drug) was mixed with 99 mL of water (100 times dilution) and vortexed to ensure the formulation was well-mixed. In addition, TAL solubility was performed in water, and bile salt/phospholipid micellar solutions. Samples were prepared by adding an excess amount of TAL to the diluted formulations and shaken with the vortex mixer occasionally while keeping in a dry heat incubator at 37&#x000b0;C for a 7-day period, this was needed to see how much TAL remained in the solution after 100 times dilution. After 7 days, the solubility of TAL was determined in the aqueous and 99% diluted formulations by similar method used for the anhydrous formulations above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> Dissolution Studies</title><p>The most efficient SNEDDS formulations were selected according to the preliminary assessment studies and optimal solubilization capacity of the TAL. The dissolution studies of the selected SNEDDS formulations were performed using an automated dissolution tester (LOGAN Instrument, Corp., Somerset, NJ, United States) connected to an automated sample collector (SP-100 peristaltic pump, Somerset, NJ, United States). The standard USP II (Model UDT-804, LOGAN, Inst. Corp., United States) paddle method was used at 37 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C. The volume of the dissolution medium was 500 ml MilliQ water with pH 1.2 and 6.8 to simulate stomach and intestinal media respectively (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kazi et al., 2017</xref>). The rotation speed of the paddle was adjusted to 50 rpm. The drug loaded formulations (encapsulated in hard gelatin capsules, size &#x0201c;00&#x0201d;) were dropped into dissolution medium using capsule sinkers to prevent the capsules from floating in the medium. The capsule was filled with SNEDDS (equivalent to 50 mg of TAL) and the commercial tablet Cordanum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> contained 50 mg of TAL.</p><p>An aliquot (3 mL) of the sample was collected periodically after 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 min and replaced by a freshly prepared equivalent volume of dissolution medium. The withdrawn samples were filtered through a 0.20 &#x003bc;m syringe filter (CHROMAFIL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PTFE-20/25) prior to TAL analysis with a UHPLC system (Dionex, Ultimate 3000, Thermo Scientific, United States) using the chromatographic conditions reported earlier (32).

After ultracentrifugation, the formulation digests were separated into an aqueous phase and a precipitated pellet phase. In this study, only two of the LFCS Types IIIB and IV representative formulations were used, where Type IV was explored as an example of the extremely hydrophilic formulation to compare their performance under the same experimental conditions.

The rats were fasted overnight, but provided with water only before the study. Animals were sacrificed by spinal dislocation. The small intestine was directly detached after a sacrifice by cutting across the duodenal upper end and the lower end of the ileum and stripping the mesentery. The small intestine was washed out carefully with Kreb&#x02019;s Ringer phosphate buffer (KRPB) solution using a syringe with a blunt end. The clean intestinal sacs were cut into 6.0 &#x000b1; 0.5 cm. The selected SNEDDS (F6) were dispersed with 1 mL of KPRB. A suspension of marketed tablet and TAL powder (control) was also dispersed in 1 ml of KRPB at same drug concentration.

Visual assessment of all Types III&#x02013;IV (F4&#x02013;F7, AF4&#x02013;AF7) formulations confirmed that the emulsion formed upon dilution with water was physically stable for several months. Both lipophillic and hydrophilic surfactants with HLB 10&#x02013;14 were able to promote self-emulsification of pure oil. However, the resulting emulsions (F2, F3, AF2, Type II) appeared crude (visually turbid/milky, higher droplet size, with lipophilic surfactant TO106V) (HLB number 10.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), whereas it was a much better appearance with hydrophilic surfactants HCO-30 (HLB number 11) for Types IIIA, IIIB, and IV. They provided fine (bluish/transparent systems without any visible particulates), uniform emulsion droplets which are more likely to empty rapidly from the stomach due to their fine particles upon dispersion. The alternative formulation (AF3) produced better appearance and lower droplet sizes compared to F3 within Type II systems. Pure fatty acid and glyceride oils (e.g., COFA- F1 and M812- AF1) showed very poor self-emulsification properties and did not form SNEDDS.

Therefore, selection of the suitable oil/surfactant components are crucial for the model drug, which can maintain the drug in solubilized form upon aqueous dilution. The solubility of TAL in aqueous solutions and 99% diluted F and AF formulations depicted in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> confirm that F1 (Coconut oil FA) has an ability of dissolving very large amounts of the TAL in anhydrous pre-concentrate but the formulation appeared immiscible upon aqueous dispersion (large oil globules with low drug solubility), thus it was avoided.</p><p>The key mechanism by which lipid-based formulations improve the bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs has been suggested to involve solubilization of drug in bile salt and phospholipid mixed micelles (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 2008</xref>). If these micellar solutions significantly increase the solubility of a poorly water-soluble drug, then the release of bile salt/phospholipid at the time of dosing could improve bioavailability substantially. <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarized the solubility of TAL in bile salt/ phospholipid solutions (FaSSIF and FeSSIF). The solubilization of TAL in water, FaSSIF and FeSSIF solution was investigated. It can be seen from the result that the presence of bile salt/phospholipid increased the solubility of TAL from 0.23 (solubility in water) 2.16 mg/ml (solubility in FaSSIF) and further increased to 4.53 mg/mL due to higher concentrations of bile salt/phospholipid in FeSSIF. The solubility increased in presence of higher bile salt/phospholipid concentration indicates that TAL would be benefited during digestion in the gut under fed/fasted conditions.</p><p>The combination of Imwitor 308 as oily phase with Transcutol (TC) (1:1) and HCO-30 as surfactant with an equal ratio (F6) showed the higher solubility in both anhydrous and 99% diluted formulations and yielded a transparent clear appearance. On the other hand, Capmul MCM (CMCM) and TC with HCO-30 as surfactant (AF6) have high equilibrium solubility in both anhydrous and 99% diluted formulation and also produced a transparent clear appearance.

Using these data, the drug can be dissolved at a lower saturation level to avoid any precipitation upon aqueous dilution. For example, if TAL was dissolved at 80% solubility in the anhydrous formulations, its solubility limit will not be exceeded for a sufficient period of time as dilution proceed and the drug may remain in solution.

There are different mechanisms could explain the increase intestinal absorption of TAL from SNEDDS formulation. The high permeation might be attributed to the rapid dissolution of TAL in the intestinal sac and a subsequent rapid diffusion. It is supposed that the higher drug absorption is due to the resultant nano-emulsion droplet size from SNEDDS in the intestinal region, which could enhance absorption of TAL (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, nanoemulsion provides a larger surface area available for permeation of the drug through the intestinal membrane. Moreover, the high drug solubility and ability of self-emulsification of the formulation F6 may have contributed to the increased intestinal absorption of TAL. The bio-enhancing activities of the ingredients used in SNEDDS (F6), which contains I308 as surfactant that improve the permeability by disturbing the lipids of the cell membrane.

The enhanced oral bioavailability of TAL may also be due to the faster uptake of the nanoemulsion resulting from SNEDDS formulation by enterocytes at the absorption site (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Elgart et al., 2013</xref>). There are several reports which confirm this view (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Mohsin et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The developed SNEDDS formulations showed a high solubility and dissolution profile of TAL in the anhydrous, 99% diluted formulations and maintained solubilized TAL mostly in aqueous phase of the digested samples <italic>in vitro.</italic> The gut permeability and oral bioavailability of the representative SNEDDS formulation was found to increase by 4- and 1.58-fold when compared to pure raw drug, respectively.
