    "Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and chemical effect of Heracleum persicum essential oil (EO), nisin, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and their combination against Listeria monocytogenes both in vitro and in Iranian white cheese model. Materials and Methods:Chemical compositions of H. persicum EO were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. After production of Iranian white cheese, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration of EO and nisin and agar spot test of L. acidophilus against L. monocytogenes were evaluated. Results:Hexyl butanoate (25.98%), octyl isobutyrate (17.82%), methyl butyrate (14.37%), and pentyl cyclopropane (12.77%) were the main components of the EO. MIC of the EO against L. monocytogenes was 2.5 mg/mL. Combination of nisin (5.3 IU/mL) and H. persicum EO (2500 Âµg/mL) showed increasing effect against L. monocytogenes (fractional inhibitory concentration = 0.9), while a higher concentration of EO and nisin showed undesirable effect on the cheese flavor. Furthermore, a combination of 1012 CFU/g L. acidophilus with H. persicum EO at the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL (T12) showed acceptable sensorial and also antibacterial results in Iranian white cheese. Conclusion:Combination of H. persicum EO, L. acidophilus, and nisin can be recommended as natural preservatives and flavoring agents in cheese."
