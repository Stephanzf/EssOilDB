The analysis of oil showed that oven and traditional roasting significantly increase (p &#x0003c; 0.05) the peroxide and thiobarbituric acid values of cocoa butter and that traditional roasting samples were the most deteriorated. Oven and traditional roasting for 10 min reduce the iodine value of the oil, but increase its acidity. The proximate and mineral composition of cocoa beans was also seriously affected during cooking.

Raw cacao beans are one of the most nutritious foods in the world and has been demonstrated to protect the body from the impact of free radicals, reduces stress and depression, protect against heart diseases and many types of cancer <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This health promoting effect of cocoa beans is generally attributed to the presence of polyphenols. The polyphenols in cocoa beans contribute to about 12&#x02013;18% of the dry weight of the whole bean. Main classes of polyphenolic compounds found in cocoa beans are simple phenols, benzoquinones, phenolic acids, flavonoids etc. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, cocoa beans are a good source of nutrients (lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins) <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Cocoa beans are mostly consumed after several processing techniques. The cocoa pre-processing steps (harvest, breaking, fermentation and drying) are mandatory to ensure good quality of beans, but cocoa flavors develop during fermentation and roasting. The most commercial products of cocoa are made with roasted beans [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The main goal of technological treatment is to improve the organoleptic properties of cocoa beans and eliminate its antinutrients (Hydrocyanate, Oxalate and Theobromine).</p><p id="p0020">During roasting, flavor precursors that are developed during fermentation interact to produce the desired chocolate flavor, which are formed between amino acids and sugars through Maillard reaction [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cocoa beans that are not roasted have bitter, acidic, astringent and nutty flavor. By roasting the cocoa beans, acidity is decreased by reducing the concentration of volatile acids <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, processing may also cause chemical changes that may decrease the nutritional value and the antioxidant property of the beans. This can negatively affect the potential health benefits arising from the consumption of cocoa beans. For example, high processing temperature can promote lipid oxidation and non-enzymatic browning, which have the property to decrease the nutritional value of foods by causing a loss of essential fatty acids, essential aminoacids and digestible carbohydrates. They also lead to the destruction of vitamins and the reduction of protein digestibility <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Besides affecting the nutritional and organoleptic properties of the beans and final products, they may generate toxic compounds which are harmful for the consumers <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">Cameroon is the fifth worldwide and the fourth African cocoa producer. In Cameroon, the crop is cultivated in almost all regions. The seeds are used for industrial and local production of chocolate, cocoa butter, cocoa tea, other sweets etc or eaten directly after roasting.</p><p id="p0030">Several studies have been reported on the effects of processing temperature and time on the nutritional value and phenolic content of edible seeds [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
