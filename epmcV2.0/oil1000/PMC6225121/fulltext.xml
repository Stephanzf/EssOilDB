Introduction</title><p>Grain is a precious resource for mankind&#x02019;s survival, and it is also a country&#x02019;s economic lifeline. However, during the storage period, food may become corrupted and inedible, resulting in substantial economic losses and threatening human life. The causes of food deterioration include pests and molds, especially in developing countries. Fungal contamination of stored seeds and grains is a serious chronic problem in the Indian storage system due to the tropical and humid climate [<xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Harvested grains are prone to infestations of different types of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., resulting in spoilage and mycotoxin contamination under particular conditions. <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. are the most typical cereal spoilage fungal species and can produce some toxic secondary metabolites such as mycotoxins in food and feedstuff. Fungal growth and relevant mycotoxin production may lead to food spoilage and affect the quality and quantity of food to various degrees [<xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In developing countries, cereal preservation is generally achieved by using chemical preservatives and controlling the storage environment. The preservatives currently used in the food industry are mostly chemically synthesized organic acids and relevant salts as well as some antioxidants. For example, methyl bromide and phosphine used in chemical fumigation measures are commonly applied worldwide to control pest and mold infestations in warehouses. However, this method has a negative impact for the environment and is a threat to human health. Thus, there is an urgent need to find a practical, effective, and nonpolluting method to replace traditional chemical fumigants to control fungal contamination of stored grain.</p><p>Natural products such as essential oils (EOs), flavonoids, alkaloids, and polysaccharides have attracted numerous researchers&#x02019; attention owing to their antimicrobial, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory functions. EOs are complex mixtures of volatile compounds extracted from plants, and the main components of EOs include aromatic and aliphatic constituents which are characterized by low molecular weight [<xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They are biosynthesized by all plant organs, such as flowers, leaves, stems, seeds, fruits, roots, wood, bark, and so forth; are usually distributed in secretory cells, cavities, canals, and epidermic cells; and can be obtained by distillation and pressing. Regarding mode of action for cells, because of a vast number of complex compound constituents, EOs appear to have no specific cellular targets [<xref rid="B4-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Owing to the complexity of the inhibitory action of EOs, it is time that the EO compounds (EOCs) should be taken into consideration to clarify the antimicrobial mechanism in detail. As typical lipophilic compounds, some related EOCs could pass through the cell wall and lipid-based cytoplasmic membrane, disturbing the structure of multilayered polysaccharides, fatty acids, and phospholipids, thereby destroying the overall cellular structure. Membrane damage is considered to be a type of cytotoxicity characteristic of EOCs. In eukaryotic cells, cell membranes and mitochondrial membranes control the ingress and egress of different components, such as ionic Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling [<xref rid="B5-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and other ionic channels. EOCs might affect the membrane expansion and change the membrane fluidity by interfering with the proton pump and the ATP pool to cause the disordering of intracellular macromolecular substances (such as nucleic acids and proteins), intracellular enzyme activities, and energy metabolism. This mode of action of EOCs might be directed to a single target or multiple targets in the cell. Once this interaction mode is triggered, anabolism is promoted or catabolism is inhibited in the cell, resulting in an imbalance between synthesis and catabolism, which in turn leads to the accumulation of energy substances. Moreover, the intracellular respiratory rate, phosphorylation, and oxidative phosphorylation efficiency are also inhibited, leading to cell death by apoptosis and necrosis [<xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>At present, some countries have used atmospheric storage technologies to store food crops. Molds are the main corrupting organisms in the grain storage ecosystem and are essentially aerobic. Consequently, creating an oxygen-deficient environment in the storage grain ecosystem has a fatal effect on molds and greatly extends the shelf life. The use of a modified atmosphere to store food crops involves changing the natural stored gas composition, which includes carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), and is lethal to pathogens. In the literature, common atmospheric storage technologies can be divided into modified atmosphere (MA) and controlled atmosphere (CA) categories [<xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Their difference is the degree of atmospheric composition. The gas composition of the artificially controlled storage is initially adjusted and dynamically changes according to the respiration rate of the crops and the permeability of the membrane or storage structure around the grain. The gas composition has been constantly controlled and monitored during the storage period. In addition to extending the storage period, atmospheric storage technology can also maintain the natural quality of the grain. Changing the gas around the food can reduce the respiration rate of the grain and inhibit the activity of microorganisms in the grain, thereby greatly prolonging the storage life of the grain.</p><p>However, there is very limited research that has studied the mode of interaction of EOCs and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. from the gene level and the function of EOCs as the grain preservative. Thence, the objective of this work was to determine the efficacy of diverse EOCs against <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and to reveal the underlying mechanism of antimicrobial activities from the aspects of cell membrane morphology, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) change, and differential gene expression. Moreover, EOCs were investigated in combination with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to further improve the grain quality regarding <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-23-02108"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-23-02108"><title>2.1. Inhibitory Effects of Geraniol and Citral on Toxigenic Fungi</title><p>Among all the tested EOs&#x02019; major components, there were several vapors of EOCs with effective inhibitory activity against <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> in vitro (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02108">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Unfortunately, the other components showed little antifungal property for the target pathogens. A possible explanation for this is that some EOCs have a special mode of action for some specific microbes. Geraniol and citral significantly inhibited mycelial growth (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and exhibited higher inhibition rates for two strains compared to other treatments. <xref rid="molecules-23-02108-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the antifungal effect with different concentrations of geraniol and citral at the seventh day after inoculation with spoilage pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of citral was 0.5 &#x003bc;L/mL for <italic>A. flavus</italic> and 0.4 &#x003bc;L/mL for <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>, whereas geraniol seemed not to fully prevent the growth of these fungi. The inhibition rate of geraniol against <italic>A. flavus</italic> was 98.44% between 0.5 and 0.6 &#x003bc;L/mL, and similarly, 98.38% against <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> at the range of 0.3 to 0.6 &#x003bc;L/mL. It was indicated that geraniol in the vapor phase might reach saturated concentration in sealed plates. Considering excellent in vitro results, geraniol and citral were chosen for subsequent in situ studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-23-02108"><title>2.2. Influence of EOC Treatments on Grain Quality Parameters</title><p>The pH with geraniol fumigation falls fast from 6.97 &#x000b1; 0.03 to 4.02 &#x000b1; 0.17 in eight days; a similar result was obtained with citral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). This was likely due to the two EOs&#x02019; major components in the vapor phase being slightly acidic. However, aluminium phosphide (AlP), a common commercial fumigant, could prominently maintain stable pH at the level of 6.54 &#x000b1; 0.04 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Fat acidity of grain treated with geraniol and citral was at the values of 1.89 &#x000b1; 0.29 and 0.42 &#x000b1; 0.07 NaOH mg/g, respectively, when compared to grain without EOCs after being infected with <italic>A. flavus</italic> for eight days (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Additionally, citral, equally to AlP, prevented the rapid rise of lipid acids of grains for both <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infections. There was a slowly increasing tendency of malondialdehyde (MDA) content in grains with EOC treatments and the content in the control group inoculated with <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> was 3.85 times that of citral at the eighth day (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). It seemed that geraniol and citral, which were the major components of <italic>Lippia rugosa</italic> EO and lemongrass EO respectively, could better delay MDA increase of grain after inoculation with <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> than <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f001">Figure 1</xref>C&#x02013;G). Meanwhile, there was no substantial difference in MDA content between the AlP and control after eight days&#x02019; infections of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. For microbial numbers, geraniol and citral could significantly reduce colonization by <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> in grain after inoculation (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f001">Figure 1</xref>D&#x02013;H). These results signified that geraniol and citral have the potential to protect grain (rice) from infection by pathogens and to delay the grains&#x02019; corruption.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-23-02108"><title>2.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Analysis</title><p>The microstructure of interactions between starch granules and fungi were observed using SEM. SEM micrographs of <italic>A. flavus</italic> or <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> on grains after treatment with EOCs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Many <italic>A. flavus</italic> mycelium and visible spores were distributed on the surface of granules, and the release of internal starch contents from boundary damage in grains was noticeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Similarly, <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> affected the integrity of starch granules seriously and resulted in some partial disruption of starches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). It was speculated that the mold occupied space gaps among starch granules and consumed nutrients, thus eroding the rice grains. After treatment with geraniol, starches appeared to follow healthy development with a regular crystalline form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) and were much larger than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, revealing that geraniol not only effectively prevented the infection of <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> on grains, but also maintained the complete structure of granules without harmful side effects. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f002">Figure 2</xref>C&#x02013;F, no apparent variation of the starch granule morphology was observed for treatment with citral; only a few existing wrinkled flattened empty hyphae.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-23-02108"><title>2.4. Determination of Cell Membrane Permeability</title><p>One approach used for determining the mode of action of the antimicrobials against the pathogens was to measure the relative electrical conductivity from the suspensions of <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The change of electrical conductivity reflected the effect of cell membrane permeability in the pathogens caused by EOC treatment. The treatments with citral and geraniol both resulted in an obvious increase of electrical conductivity in <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>. The conductivity due to electrolyte leakage in <italic>A. flavus</italic> from the control group was 79.4 &#x000b1; 4.1%, but this value reached 91 &#x000b1; 6.2% after geraniol treatment (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, there was no apparent change for <italic>A. flavus</italic> when exposed to citral.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-molecules-23-02108"><title>2.5. Effect of EOCs on Cellular ROS Increase</title><p>ROS production and accumulation in the cell exerts oxidative stress, which may lead to the damage of cellular structures and eventually induce apoptosis [<xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the antifungal action of EOCs and oxidative stress in pathogens. The results are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The ROS increase was 20.5 &#x000b1; 7.0% in <italic>A. flavus</italic> and 14.2 &#x000b1; 7.1% in <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> when treated with citral. Geraniol treatment showed a rapid increase of ROS accumulation in <italic>A. flavus</italic> and reached values of 74.2 &#x000b1; 5.5%, which indicated that geraniol treatment resulted in an evident stimulation of ROS generation. There was no significant difference in ROS increase in <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> between geraniol and citral.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-molecules-23-02108"><title>2.6. Gene Expression Analysis</title><p>For the purpose of revealing the molecular mechanisms behind the inhibitory role of the EOs&#x02019; major components in pathogens, some growth-related and secondary metabolite-related genes of <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> were monitored by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in mycelia that were treated with EOCs. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, all growth- and secondary metabolite-related genes in <italic>A. flavus</italic> were downregulated in the geraniol treatment group. Among the five downregulated genes, <italic>aflR</italic>, which is a transcription activator of aflatoxin biosynthesis, was lowly expressed after geraniol treatment. Meanwhile, the key regulatory gene of secondary metabolites, <italic>laeA</italic>, was downregulated with an average 11.1-fold decrease when exposed to citral. In addition, both citral and geraniol resulted in the expression reduction of the sporulation gene <italic>brlA</italic> compared to the control.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-molecules-23-02108"><title>2.7. Cotreatment with EOCs and MAP for Cereal Preservation</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f006">Figure 6</xref> presents the quality characteristics and growth of spoilage organisms on fresh rice with significant synergistic treatments of EOCs and MAP (CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>). The pH dropped fast in all MAP conditions without EOCs eight days after inoculation with <italic>A. flavus</italic>. The pH in the control had a fluctuation, but a stable level of pH was observed for <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> with treatment with the combined EOCs and different gas composition. In terms of the content of fatty acids, compared to the untreated control and AlP, the geraniol or citral combined with MAP obviously postponed the increase of fatty acid content whether the grains were challenged with <italic>A. flavus</italic> or <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>. The fatty acid content in geraniol with 100% CO<sub>2</sub> treatment reached the lowest level of 0.11 NaOH mg/g and was one-tenth of that of the control group. Moreover, fatty acid content had a gradual decline with the increasing proportion of CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere composition over eight days when using the same EOCs in each group. With respect to MDA content, no distinct changes for either pathogen were illustrated in the effects of the diversified gas treatments with geraniol or citral as a fumigant. Concurrently, the cotreatment of geraniol or citral with identical MAP manifested higher MDA content in comparison with the sterile water control and AlP positive control. In the light of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f006">Figure 6</xref>D&#x02013;H, the combined EOCs and MAP effectively delayed the growth of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. on grains after eight days&#x02019; exposure when compared to the single MAP treatment. In particular, the EOC treatments together with 100% CO<sub>2</sub> gas packaging nearly inhibited <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth in grains. In addition, packaging with gas components of 50% CO<sub>2</sub>:50% N<sub>2</sub> and 75% CO<sub>2</sub>:25% N<sub>2</sub> associated with citral denoted a better antifungal effect against <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> than AlP, and their reduction levels were 4.78 log<sub>10</sub> colony forming unit (CFU)/g and 4.17 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g, respectively. However, there were no obvious differences in the effect of the other gas compositions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-23-02108"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Cereals represent the most important source of food samples in many countries. They have been highly susceptible to pathogens and their secretion of mycotoxins due to the disturbance or aging of tissue physiology and mechanical damage preharvest and postharvest, which not only causes large pecuniary losses, but also a serious threat to human health. Recently, the use of a number of natural-product-derived volatile chemicals in crops and food for the treatment of diverse agricultural diseases has drawn widespread attention from researchers. Polyphenols, vitamins, alkaloids, saponins, polysaccharides, and bioactive peptides derived from many different plants have displayed antioxidant capabilities and antimicrobial activities. Plant EOs and related EOCs, odorous and volatile products with diversified bioactive functions formed by secondary metabolism, have been applied in medicine and as food additives, such as flavor enhancers, aromatizers, and preservatives.</p><p>In this study, we tested about 30 plant EOs (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02108">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and their major compounds to evaluate their antifungal activity against two typical pathogens of grains (<italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>) by fumigation. In solid media, only seven vaporous EOCs exhibited an inhibitory effect against the above molds (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02108">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), and two EOCs (citral and geraniol) with better properties were appropriate for subsequent studies. The impact of these two EOCs on fungal growth was increased progressively with concentration. Interestingly, <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> with treatment of geraniol at the concentration of 0.3 to 0.6 &#x003bc;L/mL was not completely inhibited, owing to the saturation of geraniol in the vapor phase.</p><p>Based on the previous results about the inhibitory effect of EOCs in vitro, we decided to choose the best antifungal EOCs for in situ experiments. The pH value, fatty acid content, MDA content, and colony number parameters of the grain were tested to make a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of grain quality after EOC treatment. The pH declined as storage time increased, which was accounted for by the reason that the two EOCs were slightly acidic. A recent study declared that the decreasing pH was mainly caused by the degradation of proteins and metabolism of pathogens in rice, and the pH balance in cells would improve the nitrogen use efficiency of rice to extend storage life [<xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. EOCs with low pH values in foodstuffs were more hydrophobic and had more affinity to the target hydrophobic areas of proteins in the bacterial cell membrane [<xref rid="B10-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, the lower pH of grain may help the EOCs play a better inhibitory effect against pathogens. With respect to fatty acid content, the increase of lipid acidity level being an early indicator of mold spoilage, some toxigenic fungus produced lipase in suitable conditions, which accelerated the hydrolysis of rice fats and caused an increase the fatty acid content of grain [<xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that citral significantly postponed the ascent of fatty acid content. MDA is the ultimate product of membrane lipid peroxidation in rice plants, and the cell undergoes oxidative stress with the increase of lipid peroxidation level and the accumulation of MDA [<xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, the EOCs could maintain the lower level of MDA to protect the rice from oxidative damage. Concerning the microbial numbers, these parasitic microbes competed with the grains for oxygen and derive nutrients from grain tissues for their growth to deter grain respiration [<xref rid="B14-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Besides, there are many factors, such as temperature, humidity, pH, and microorganisms, which consistently impact the efficacy of the combined biofungicides in the field experiments. Thus, the major compounds of EOs at the MIC in vitro used in grain could not realize the complete inactivation of fungi in situ. SEM analysis signified that both geraniol and citral effectively protected starch granules from the challenge of <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>. It was previously found that carvacrol was very effective when used against the foodborne pathogen <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> at 0.15&#x02013;0.75 &#x003bc;L/g on boiled rice [<xref rid="B16-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which indicated that EOCs could be used in food or agricultural products to achieve potential antibacterial activity.</p><p>The mode of action of EOCs for microbes could be attributed to the changing permeability of cell membranes and walls, as well as to the DNA, to alter gene expression, cellular respiration, and energy metabolism and eventually kill the cells [<xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our current study, we explored citral and geraniol as bioactive agents against <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> for grains and the underlying antifungal mechanisms. <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> were completely inhibited at the MIC of citral and geraniol in vitro, at which growth and metabolism of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. could not be detected; therefore, we adopted lower concentrations of citral and geraniol for use with the two pathogens to better expound the antifungal action of the EOs&#x02019; major components. The modes of antifungal action of citral and geraniol on the common <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. of grain were investigated by evaluating cell membrane permeability, cellular ROS change, and growth and secondary metabolite gene expression. According to the results for relative conductivity, both EOCs showed a better capability of increasing cell membrane permeability in <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> compared to <italic>A. flavus</italic>, which led to the leakage of intracellular constituents. It was likely that the leakage was caused by the interaction between antimicrobial ingredients and the cytoplasmic membrane [<xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The different relative conductivity changes of <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and <italic>A. flavus</italic> might be due to the involvement of different components and binding sites of the cell membrane when treated with the same EOC. Meanwhile, the electrical conductivity of <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> increased by 28.3% and 28.8% after exposure to citral and geraniol, respectively, indicating that the integrity of the cell membrane was partially disrupted. When damage to the cell membrane occurred, more small molecules such as electrolytes were released, causing the higher electrical conductivity to accelerate cell death [<xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress is considered as a signal for inducing cell death in response to various external environmental stresses and internal psychophysiological stimulation. ROS, mainly generated in the mitochondria through the oxidative process, are a series of intermediate products formed during the process of oxygen metabolism, and excessive ROS attack cellular biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNA to cause irreversible oxidative damage [<xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This study indicated that citral and geraniol induced rapid and significant ROS production in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This result was in agreement with a previous report which showed that citral and carvacrol caused oxidative damage in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Besides, it was inferred that ROS formation was the main factor for the inhibition of <italic>A. flavus</italic> by geraniol, according to a 74.2% ROS increase. Previous investigations suggested that high ROS levels reduced intracellular antioxidants, impaired DNA and proteins, and thus triggered cell damage or apoptosis [<xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The mechanism of microbial inactivation by ROS assumed that ROS involved the formation of Fenton-mediated hydroxyl radicals through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ultimately initiated cell death [<xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The accumulating evidence implied that the geraniol swiftly facilitated the induction of more ROS in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, which was similar to a prior study which described that cinnamaldehyde inhibited <italic>A. flavus</italic> by interfering with the intracellular redox system to affect metabolic regulation [<xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>To reveal the inhibitory effects of citral and geraniol on <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> from a molecular perspective, some key genes which were closely associated with growth and toxin metabolism were detected. The expression profile of key regulatory genes of aflatoxin biosynthesis and growth in <italic>A. flavus</italic> were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02108-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Among these genes, the transcriptional activator gene of asexual sporulation <italic>brlA</italic> and the global regulatory gene of secondary metabolite <italic>laeA</italic> were both highly downregulated by citral. Previous research demonstrated that disruption or deletion of the <italic>brlA</italic> gene resulted in loss of the ability for premature development in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It was elucidated that citral modulated growth-related genes of <italic>A. flavus</italic> to achieve its antifungal property. Interestingly, we observed that the citral and geraniol not only influenced the growth regulatory genes, but also had inhibitory capacity for the expression of secondary metabolism-related genes, especially for aflatoxin biosynthetic genes, which signified that citral and geraniol had sufficiently inhibited them to prevent aflatoxin from being synthesized in addition to retarding <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth at low concentrations. The <italic>aflS</italic> gene is a pathway regulator, and <italic>AflR</italic> is a transcriptional activator of aflatoxin pathway cluster structural genes [<xref rid="B25-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. When <italic>A. flavus</italic> was in an appropriate condition, <italic>AflS</italic> bound to <italic>AflR</italic> to form a complex and seek a promoter region for aflatoxin biosynthesis [<xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, in our study, it was found that citral and geraniol could inhibit major biosynthetic genes. This is consistent with previous reports, which manifested that cinnamaldehyde, citral, and eugenol inhibited aflatoxin production in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> by downregulating the aflatoxin pathway genes (<italic>aflR</italic>, <italic>aflT</italic>, <italic>aflD</italic>, <italic>aflM</italic>, and <italic>aflP</italic>) [<xref rid="B27-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, aflatoxin accumulation was achieved in the context of sporulation. It was suggested that citral and geraniol resulted in mycotoxin prevention by inhibiting the sporulation gene <italic>brlA</italic>.</p><p>Concerning the transcriptional level in <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>, although the growth and metabolite biosynthesis of <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> at the molecular level have not been completely elucidated, some of critical genes have been strongly correlated with metabolite pathways. <italic>PacC</italic> is a pH-dependent, alkaline-induced regulator responsible for growth in <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> [<xref rid="B28-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, the <italic>pacC</italic> gene was effectively induced at a transcriptional level in <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> treated by citral, which explicated the mode of action of citral against <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>. Nevertheless, geraniol treatment appeared to have no apparent inhibitory effect on <italic>pacC</italic>. A different mode of action for geraniol might be illustrated. Additionally, ochratoxin, as a secondary metabolite, was a polyketide mycotoxin mainly produced by <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. and <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp., and was classified as a group 2B potential carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid="B29-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Ochratoxin biosynthesis is dependent on enzymatic reactions because of its special molecular structure. Thence, <italic>pks</italic> and <italic>p450-B03</italic>, as two key genes which encode a polyketide synthase and a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, respectively, have played a vital role in the ochratoxin biosynthesis of <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> [<xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In line with these findings, qRT-PCR analyses denoted that both citral and geraniol had negative regulation effects on <italic>pks</italic> and <italic>p450-B03</italic> to inhibit the ochratoxin production. These results were supported by the evidence which revealed that clove, cinnamon, lemongrass, and mandarin EOs suppressed the relative expression of the selected ochratoxin-related genes [<xref rid="B32-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, some earlier works showed that citrus EOs and their major components exerted inhibitory effects on fungal growth, but not on toxin accumulation, and even induced the higher production of ochratoxin in <italic>A. westerdijkiae</italic> [<xref rid="B33-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This is not inexplicable, given that EOCs with low doses might create stress conditions and stimulate the enhancement of secondary metabolism in fungi for resisting external pressures. Previous research also demonstrated that geraniol interfered with bilayer fluidity and caused genotoxicity in some fungi [<xref rid="B35-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which was further confirmed to be a consistent explanation of the antifungal mode of specific EOCs.</p><p>There is no doubt that the antifungal activity of EOCs can be attributable to multiple mechanisms because of the complexity of fungal cell structure and composition. However, not all of these mechanisms are involved in fungal inactivation and they might have many intricate causal or feedback relationships. In accordance with our study, citral exhibited antifungal activity mainly by diminishing the sporulation- and growth-related genes for <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>. The geraniol displayed inhibitory effectiveness against <italic>A. flavus</italic> predominantly by increasing the intracellular ROS accumulation and showed toxicity against <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> principally by impairing the cell membrane.</p><p>EOC volatiles appear to be promising control methods against microorganisms in packaging. The majority of the work initiated so far has concentrated on the control effects of EOCs or MAP single treatments against pathogen contamination in grain. In our study, EOCs in combination with MAP administered to rice displayed weakened grain respiration with less loss of EOCs in the vapor phase, achieving the better preservation effect. MAP (100% CO<sub>2</sub>) showed complete inactivation for <italic>A. flavus</italic>, with &#x0003c;1.0 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g after eight days of storage. Owing to <italic>A. flavus</italic> being an aerobic fungus, high-purity CO<sub>2</sub> could exert an antifungal effect by affecting the enzymatic decarboxylation of <italic>A. flavus</italic> [<xref rid="B37-molecules-23-02108" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, the 100% CO<sub>2</sub> treatment of grain is impractical during industrial grain storage because of high cost and high energy consumption. The lower level of CO<sub>2</sub> combined with EOCs should be taken into consideration.</p><p>AlP is the chemical fumigant commonly used to control the corruption of grain; however, PH<sub>3</sub> released by AlP might be harmful for human health. Based on our results, citral or geraniol cotreatment with MAP significantly alleviated spoilage in grain and preserved grain quality to a maximum without any chemical residue, as opposed to AlP treatment, which indicated that the EOs&#x02019; major components as a novel potential approach could displace the conventional chemical fumigant for future use in grain preservation. Additionally, EOCs combined with MAP had better effects on reducing colony number and improving grain quality than EOC or MAP treatments alone. Therefore, a low dose of EOCs combined with modern preservation technology such as low temperature and MAP could not only reduce the growth of pathogens for extending the shelf life of agricultural products, but also maintain sensory quality.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-23-02108"><title>4.

An autoclaved piece of disc pipetted with essential oil separately was added into each container. The treatments were designated as follows: (A) geraniol; (B) citral; (C) AlP (positive control); and (D) sterile distilled water (negative control). Thereafter, these containers were packaged under various modified atmospheres with a MAP machine (DT-6D, Dajiang Intelligent Equipment, China) and were instantly heat-sealed by a vacuum sealer. The different modified atmospheres were appointed as follows: (I) 25% CO<sub>2</sub> and 75% N<sub>2</sub>; (II) 50% CO<sub>2</sub> and 50% N<sub>2</sub>; (III) 75% CO<sub>2</sub> and 25% N<sub>2</sub>; and (IV) 100% CO<sub>2</sub>. Thereafter, these packing boxes were stored on an artificial climate chest at 25&#x02013;30 &#x000b0;C and 80&#x02013;90% relative humidity (RH) for 8 days.

Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrated that two EOCs (citral and geraniol) have antimicrobial effects against two pathogens (<italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>) in vitro and in grain, and explored their mode of action. The results indicated that citral and geraniol could apparently inhibit fungal growth at certain concentrations by changing cell membrane permeability, inducing intracellular accumulation of ROS, and interfering with key related genes. Furthermore, the citral and geraniol in combination with MAP could have synergistic effects on controlling <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. infection of grain, which presents an alternative preservation method to improve the shelf life of grain by using natural bioactive substances. Collectively, these EOCs could provide a basis for the development of novel grain preservatives for practical applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the financial support from China and Zhejiang Province.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Sample Availability:</bold> Samples of the essential oil compounds are available from the authors.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-molecules-23-02108"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The tables including the inhibitory activity of EOCs and plant EOs against <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. and primers for this study are available in the supplementary files online.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="molecules-23-02108-s001"><media xlink:href="molecules-23-02108-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>X.T. and Y.-L.S. performed the experiments and analyzed the data; W.-W.Z. and Y.-J.T. designed the experiments and discussed the data.
