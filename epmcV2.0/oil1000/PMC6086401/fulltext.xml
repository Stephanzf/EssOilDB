However, it is an ignored crop in Pakistan. In order to improve the crop productivity and reduce the use of agrochemicals for sustainable biodiesel feedstock production, an experiment was conducted for two years to improve the fatty acid composition and oil quality of <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L. (safflower) by the inoculation of <italic>Azospirillum</italic> and <italic>Azotobacter</italic> alone as well as in combined application with nitrogen and phosphate (NP) fertilizers on cultivars Thori and Saif-32 under field conditions. Separation and quantification of fatty acids were done on precise comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC&#x000d7;GC). The results showed that fatty acid profile specifically monounsaturated fatty acids i-e oleic acid (C18:1) was significantly improved by <italic>Azospirillum</italic> supplemented with the quarter dose of NP fertilizers (SPQ) with concomitant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids by the respective treatment. Oil quality attributes such as acid value, saponification number, iodine value, refractive index and free fatty acid contents were reduced by the application of <italic>Azotobacter</italic> and <italic>Azospirillum</italic> in combination with half and quarter doses of NP fertilizers treatments (BTH, SPH, BTQ and SPQ). The reduction in these variables is positively linked with improved biodiesel yield and quality. It can be concluded that application of <italic>Azospirillum</italic> and <italic>Azotobacter</italic> not only reduced the use of NP fertilizers up to 50%&#x02013;75% but also improved the oil quality in order to obtain environment friendly, sustainable and green fuel.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004681</institution-id><institution>Higher Education Commission, Pakistan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106-1822-Bm6-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4778-9294</contrib-id><name><surname>Nosheen</surname><given-names>Asia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Furthermore, authors are grateful to the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan for providing funding (No. 106-1822-Bm6-05) to accomplish this piece of work successfully and also extend thanks to Monash University, Australia for collaborative research.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to increased growth of population and change in life style, the consumption of energy has been increased in these days. This increase in the demand of energy, limiting the resources of fossil fuel and rising the prices of oil internationally have renewed the interest towards the search of alternative sources of energy (fuels) [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, there is an increasing problem of global warming, accumulation of greenhouse gases and environmental pollution leading to climate change which in turn influences the crop productivity. The search for the renewable, sustainable and environmental friendly energy resources is the key factor for improving the economy of a country and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, in order to meet the energy demands, each country is focusing to search the alternative energy sources and among those, biofuel (i-e biodiesel) is one option. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, main barrier for the production of biodiesel is competition with use of oil for food. Measures which can be adopted to overcome this conflict are to use non edible oil resources, to increase production using waste land areas and to improve the productivity of crops by various measures such as use of chemical and biofertilizers (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria: PGPR).</p><p>Due to incessant use of chemical fertilizers, soil ecology has been subverted which resulted in many environmental problems such as degradation of soil fertility status, soil toxicity, contamination of ground water which leads towards the adverse effects on environment as well as on human [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The amalgamation of bio-fertilizers and chemicals is one of the essential measures for the production of sustainable agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Biofertilizer is the term used for fertilizers which are composed up of living microorganism and enhance the growth and productivity of plant by various mechanisms when applied to the rhizospheric soil or the seed of the plant. For sustainable and eco-friendly farming ecosystem, the application of biofertilizers is an appropriate option which helps to reduce the environmental problems due to a considerable extent. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The use of PGPR to enhance plant growth and yield and improve soil health is an emerging trend in present day agriculture. Application of combinations of PGPR and chemical fertilizer improved the yield traits, grain yield, and production of dry matter of barley crop by direct or indirect mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p><italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L. (safflower) is among the important oil seed crops and it is adapted for salt and drought stress conditions. Principally, it is cultivated for the oil used both for food and industrial implications and it is a potential source of biodiesel. As safflower is composed up of complex mixture of unsaturated fatty acids and the separation and quantification of those fatty acids on one dimensional gas chromatography was not satisfactory. Therefore, the use of comprehensive two-dimensional chromatograms containing many peaks and higher peak capacities [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] improves analyses. Another advantage is the formation of two dimensional chromatogram of chemically similar compound which can help for the identification of unknown compounds [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A part of this study containing agronomic, biomass, biochemical and yield data of safflower in response to <italic>Azospirillum</italic>, <italic>Azotobacter</italic> and NP fertilizers and the method developed for fatty acid analysis by comprehensive two-dimensional chromatography (GC&#x000d7;GC) has already been published [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This part of the study was aimed to improve the oil quality of substrate (i-e safflower) used as a feedstock for biodiesel production using ecofriendly sustainable measures by altering the composition of fatty acids as well as refining oil properties that directly affect the biodiesel quality. Two cultivars of safflower were selected to know their performance under provided conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Under the natural conditions, an experiment was conducted on field scale in 2011 and 2012 at the Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University.

The present results showed an interesting finding that <italic>Azospirillum</italic> in combination with quarter dose of NP fertilizers (SPQ) gave a considerable increase in oleic acid content. Oleic acid is an important fatty acid to obtain good quality biodiesel production, improving biodiesel properties such as cold flow properties, oxidation stability, specific gravity, cetane number and viscosity. Therefore, supplementing PGPR (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria) with quarter doses of NP fertilizers would help to improve the quality of oil suitable for biodiesel production. The present findings are in line with those of Dhanasekar and Dhandapani [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who reported that application of PGPR such as <italic>Azospirillum</italic>, <italic>Azotobacter</italic> and <italic>Rhizobium</italic> in combination with chemical fertilizers significantly influenced the seed yield and oil quality in sunflower. In the present study, a single inoculation of <italic>Azospirillum</italic> and <italic>Azotobacter</italic> also enhanced oleic acid content compared to that of control which is in agreement with the findings of Texier [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who reported that inoculation of sunflower with PGPR improved the unsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio and also seed oil content. Similarly, Choudhury and Kennedy [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that inoculation of sunflower with nitrogen fixing bacteria increased the phosphorus level which in turn influenced the seed oil content and the unsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio. Previously, various scientists [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0201738.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that the presence of PGPR (specifically nitrogen fixing bacteria) in the rhizosphere and their relationship with the plants improved the nitrogen use efficiency of the plant. Moreover, the production of hormones by the PGPR not only stimulates the development of the roots but also enhanced the nutrient acquisition capability of the plants. These changes impart the alterations in metabolic processes which are responsible for the improved yield and oil quality of the crops. Taken together these facts, the inoculation of PGPB (Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria) reduces the use of fertilizers which are of important environmental concerns of the day. Jha et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported that transformation of <italic>Azospirillum brasilense</italic> ACP and its functional expression in <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> not only increased oleic acid and linoleic acid but also resulted in a parallel reduction of C22:1. Our results indicated that half dose of NP fertilizers resulted in improving the fatty acid composition in terms of oleic acid which confirm the findings of Texier [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who demonstrated that in oil seed crops, during the process of seed development, the fatty acid composition is under genetic control and the process of fatty acid biosynthesis requires the C and N skeleton and thus nitrogen fertilizers play an important role in modifying the fatty acid composition of oil seed crops. Di Benedetto et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that the PGPB isolated from the soil of South Italy showed improved nutrient and nitrogen use efficiency of the wheat crop. This nutrient/nitrogen use efficiency of the crops is an important factor for the metabolic processes which provide nutrients (C, N) for the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Hence, the nitrogen use efficiency play important role in alteration of fatty acid composition of the respective crop. Gopinath et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that fatty acid methyl esters significantly influenced the cetane number of biodiesel, which increases with increase in chain length and decreases with degree of unsaturation. In the present study, the ratio of monounsaturated (oleic acid)/polyunsaturated (linolenic acid) was significantly increased by the SPQ treatment which plays important role in the improvement of the oil quality and oxidation stability with perspective to biodiesel production. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are more prone to oxidation and lead to poor storage properties of biodiesel as compared to monounsaturated fatty acids [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201738.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> showed that there is a negative correlation between monounsaturated (oleic acid) and polyunsaturated (linolenic acid) which leads toward the improvement of oxidation stability of the oil and it is a very important finding of the study.</p><fig id="pone.0201738.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0201738.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation between fatty acid and oil quality attributes of a) cv.

Acid value is an important variable for monitoring the quality of biodiesel during transeterification reaction and storage. According to the present study, maximum reduction in acid value was resulted by BTQ treatment in cv. Saif-32. These findings are in parallel to that of Abd El-Gawad et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] who reported that <italic>Azotobacter chroococcum and Bacillus megaterium</italic> reduced the acid value and peroxide value of canola as compared to the control. Similar findings were reported by Nosheen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that acid value, free fatty acid contents and specific gravity of canola oil were significantly reduced by the application of <italic>Azospirillum</italic> and chemical fertilizers treatments. The reduction in the above mentioned parameters lead towards the decrease in engine corrosion, rancidity and density of oil; hence, indirectly improved the quality of oil for biodiesel production and also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. Dodos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that due to increase in acid value of vegetable oil, formation of shorter fatty acid and acidic secondary oxidation products occurred which leads to the corrosion of engine [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The decrease in acid value might be due to the production of phytohormone by PGPR as Ullah and Bano [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported that application of cytokinin decreased the acid value of safflower oil. The lower acidity of vegetable oil and biodiesel leads to a considerable increase in oxidation stability and improved storage properties of the fuel [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Results in the current study indicated that treatment SP resulted in maximum reduction of free fatty acid content of oil followed by BT, BTF and BTQ treatments respectively. It is reported that the yield of biodiesel is highly influenced by the presence of free fatty acid in the oil during base catalysed transesterification reaction [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The presence of free fatty acid contents in higher amount resulted in soap formation and ultimately leading to the reduction of biodiesel yield and quality [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Saponification number is an important variable that affects the quality of biodiesel. Our results indicated a reduction in saponification value especially with the BTQ treatment. Saponification is negatively correlated with the degree of unsaturation [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It was reported in the previous study that application of nitrogen fertilizer at the rate of 108&#x02013;216 kg per hectare to the plant reduced the saponifiable number and refractive index and lead to parallel increase in unsaponifiable number [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; however no literature was found for the effect of PGPR on oil saponification number.</p><p>Refractive index and Iodine value are important factors strongly correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201738.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>) and with degree of unsaturation of fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acid has higher iodine values and refractive indexes as compared to monounsaturated fatty acid [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The present work showed that maximum reduction in both the variables was resulted in SPQ treatment. These results are in line with the findings of Lawania et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] who reported that the application of nitrogen fertilizers in combination with biofertilizers (<italic>Azotobacter</italic>) reduced the iodine value of linseed oil. Reduced values of iodine and refractive indices improve the quality and oxidation stability of oil [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. There is a negative correlation between oleic acid content and other oil quality parameters such as acid value, free fatty acid, iodine value, refractive index etc. It is an important finding of the study because increase in oleic acid and in parallel decrease in acid value, free fatty acid, iodine value, refractive index etc. imparts good quality biodiesel production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201738.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>) by improving the oxidation stability and improving other properties of biodiesel. The higher iodine value tends to result in deposit formation hence causes problems of storage stability. Iodine value decrease with decrease in refractive index and improves the quality and oxidation stability of oil [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Ahmad et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201738.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that impregnation of PGPB with urea and DAP improved the nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency by the wheat plant and also improved the photosynthetic rate and yield. The PGPB such as <italic>Azospirillum</italic> improved the nitrogen use efficiency by biological nitrogen fixation and facilitate the uptake of nutrient by the plants. As the treatments containing PGPB with reduced amount of fertilizers (half or quarter doses) are efficient in improving the oil quality, as a result these treatments reduced the application of chemical fertilizers which is the important finding of the study and leads towards the ecofriendly sustainable agriculture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It can be concluded from the above results and discussion that oil quality parameters such as fatty acid profile and oil properties were significantly improved by the inoculation of PGPR supplemented with quarter and half rates of NP fertilizers. Oleic acid content and C18:1/C18:3 ratios were significantly improved by <italic>Azospirillum</italic> in combination with half rate of NP fertilizers. However, oil properties such as acid value, iodine value, refractive index etc. were significantly improved by BTQ and SPQ treatments in both the varieties. The behaviour of the varieties varies in response to provided treatments for the specific parameter. According to these results we can reduced the use of NP fertilizers upto 50%&#x02013;75% with the application of <italic>Azospirillum</italic> and <italic>Azotobacter</italic> for green, sustainable and environment friendly good quality biodiesel production. However, further research at molecular level is needed to confirm the interaction of PGPR with fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. In order to achieve the goal of better safflower oil quality production, the exploration of molecular pathways in combination with biochemical and genetic approaches which are linked with the current study are needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201738.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Minimal data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201738.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201738.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>ANOVA Tables_Supplemental file.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201738.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors are grateful to the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan for providing funding (No. 106-1822-Bm6-05) to accomplish this piece of work successfully and also extend thanks to Monash University, Australia for collaborative research.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0201738.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Maravi</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Goud</surname><given-names>VV</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sakurai</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
