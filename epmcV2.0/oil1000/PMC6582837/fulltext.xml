Introduction</title><p>Pistacia is a genus of Anacardiaceae family, of about 11 or more species, which are shrubs or trees. Three Pistacia species (<italic>P. vera Linnaeus</italic>,<italic> P. khinjuk Stocks</italic>, and<italic> P. Atlantica)</italic> naturally occur,<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>is the wildest species widely distributed, from southern-west Asia to northern-west Africa [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A large number of wild<italic> Pistacia atlantica </italic>subsp.<italic> Kurdica</italic> trees are widely distributed in the Zagros Mountains; West and North of Iran, East and North of Iraq, South of Turkey, and North of Syria [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The mastic gum exudates from the plant stem traditionally have been used in Greek medicine for treatment of gastrointestinal disorders like gastralgia, dyspepsia, and peptic ulcer for many years [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; the gum possess considerable antibacterial and antifungal activity [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Essential oils are fragrant volatile substances biosynthesized by several parts of plants, which is commonly used for many years for combating pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The terpenoids and some hydrocarbons that found in essential oils are responsible for their antimicrobial effect [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Studies suggested that terpenoids that diffuse within the cell membrane of bacteria, damaging it irreversibly, lead to bacterial death, because they are lipophilic in nature; these terpenes cause expansion of the membrane, increase fluid flow, and deactivate the enzymes placed within the membrane [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Pistacia species have caught the interest of researchers due to studies on different parts of this plant such as the leaves, kernels, hulls, and gum demonstrating various biological benefits such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory potential [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been proven that Pistachio species are a rich source of phenolic compounds and they have also been considered a source of high antioxidant activity [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> is major periodontal pathogens and one of the main etiological agents in the inflammatory episodes of periodontal disease initiation and progression [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Plant-derived essential oil products have been widely used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of periodontitis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Biocompatibility (or tissue compatibility) is the capacity of a material to promote adequate host response when introduced as purposed [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

<italic>Histopathological Evaluations of Cutaneous Incised Wound Healing</italic>. The histological evaluation of healed wound area at 1 week after wounding revealed granulation phase or inflammatory phase, for instance, the cutaneous wound, did not close completely and showed a scab formed by necrotic tissue remnants, fibrin, and polymorphonuclear cells infiltration with marked inflammatory cell infiltration in dermis and hypodermis in control group. Additionally, collagen fibers were seen in disorganized arrangement with fibroblast proliferation seen in the dermal layer (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(c)</xref>). A clear line of demarcation seen between scab and dermis under the necrotic tissue in a tetracycline-treated group in which the wound closed if compared to the control group, moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells in epidermis extends to dermis and hypodermis with the presence of newly formed collagen fibers and fibroblast proliferation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(d)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(f)</xref>). While in<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil treated group the demarcation line was completely clear, and the wound more progressed in healing if compared to the control and tetracycline groups, the fibrin net was rich in PMNs. The regeneration of the epidermis was completely started; moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells, the proliferation, and migration of fibroblasts were obvious. Angiogenesis was observed, but the number of fibroblasts increased in the dermis near the wounded area with new collagen formation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(g)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(i)</xref>).</p><p>At 4 weeks after wounding, more progress in wound healing (proliferative phase) was apparent; in the control group an early phase of reepithelization process was seen; the immature-hyperplastic and disorganized epidermis superimposing the area of the wound increased in thickness of dermal layer by deposition of unorganized collagen fibers as a bundles or individual with fibroblast proliferation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref>). While late phase of the reepithelization process was seen in treated groups, for example, reepithelialization was markedly completed and tissue regeneration had better quality, collagen fibers were thicker and denser in the tetracycline-treated group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(d)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(f)</xref>). Whereas in<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica</italic> gum oil treated group the healing became more evident and the epidermis showed a typical histological picture of the proliferative phase, immature-hyperplastic and disorganized epidermis overlying the area of the wound, at the layer of dermis, fibroblasts were vertically oriented predominantly, and mature collagen fibers exhibited more evident organization pattern than the tetracycline-treated group also control group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(g)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(i)</xref>).</p><p>Histological analysis of healed wound area in the control group at 8 weeks after wounding revealed early remodeling phase, wounds are fully reepithelialized with minimum keratinization, scar tissue formed with marked intensity and loaded with the mild infiltration of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts), and well-organized thick bundles of collagen fibers were also observed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(c)</xref>), while in treated groups the wound showed late stage of remodeling phase with full maturation of the wound, and the final steps of dermal reorganization are proceeding but with the variable levels; for instance, in tetracycline-treated group, the mature wound showed well-organized epidermis with dermal papillae development, while the scar intensity ranged from mild-moderate and minimum degree of inflammatory cells infiltration and well-organized thick bundles of collagen fibers (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(d)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(f)</xref>), in comparison to the<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil treated group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(g)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(i)</xref>); reepithelialization was markedly completed and tissue regeneration had better quality, the mature wound revealed the remodeling phase including normal thickness of epidermis and keratinization and mild-moderate scar tissue intensity with mild numbers of inflammatory cells with well-organized thick bundles of collagen fibers in the dermal layer, but the cutaneous annexes do not appear.</p><p>
<italic>Assessment of the Inflammatory Reaction or Process in the Opening Tube Site</italic>.

The MIC of the essential oils of the gum of<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>against<italic> P. gingivalis</italic> in this study was 12.5<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L/ml by using serial dilution method and the MIC was equivalent to the MBC of the oil against the<italic> P. gingivalis</italic>, indicating a bactericidal effect of the oil. The difference between bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect is clinically important in that bactericidal agents may be more effective in the treatment of diseases [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>As Memariani et al. [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in their study stated that alpha-pinene at high concentration causes disruption of bacterial cell membrane integrity; this function is the reason for its bactericidal activity.</p><p>Histological process in wound healing is three stages including inflammation, proliferation, and remolding [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Wound healing is a dynamic and complex process in which the damaged tissue layers and cellular structure should be restored into the normal state as closely as possible. Lipid peroxidation is an important process wound healing. Collagen fibrils viability increases by inhibiting lipid peroxidation [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Histological findings of this study on 1 week showed that the tissue regeneration is much better in skin wounds treated with tetracycline and<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica</italic> gum oil than in control skin wounds. Although these results were based on the profitable effects of the both treated materials on the morphology of dermal wound healing, yet the newly synthetized collagens were still unorganized and distributed randomly in all rats at this stage. In the current study better healing progression in rat of<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil treated group due to the presence of phenols and flavonoids that reduce the lipid peroxidation and can improve vascularity, collagen synthesis promotes cross linking of collagen because the Pistacia phenolics act as primary antioxidants or free radical scavengers and this finding in accordance with the previous studies that evaluated the histological examination of wound healing and indicated that the phenolics component of the<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>can reduce damaged tissue layers and accelerate wound healing [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In our result the mean and score of inflammatory cells increased significantly in<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil treated group than the control and tetracycline groups, particularly the neutrophil and the lymphocytes.

These results in agreement with studies that showed<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil as gels improved epithelialization through better organization of collagen fibers [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or due to the anti-inflammatory activity of this extract through regression of mononuclear inflammatory cells with enhancing the fibroblast growth and proliferation leading to fastening of the healing [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The mean numbers and the scores of the inflammatory reaction that surrounded opening tube were regressed in the all groups significantly, even within the same group when compared to the 1 week of the study, particularly the mononuclear inflammatory cells in the<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>gum oil treated groups if compared to the tetracycline drug while the polymorph nuclear cells slightly increased; this may be the irritant influence of high contents of extracts during the wound healing process as mentioned before in the stages of wound healing [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and also for increasing the eosinophil throughout the study in this group.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrated that the wound healing and repair in the 8 weeks were more evident and had better remodeling in the treated groups than the control group, particularly in the rats of the<italic> Pistacia atlantica Kurdica </italic>oil treated group, that showed complete reepithelialization and tissue regeneration but the cutaneous annexes do not appear in comparison to the tetracycline-treated group. Moreover, reduction in total cellularity and enhancing fibroblast maturation and differentiation were observed in the wound area in both treated group that in accordance with the study of Kahkeshani et al. said that a plant to be an effective wound healer, its active constituents need to have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities.
