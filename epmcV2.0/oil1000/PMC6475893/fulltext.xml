The purposes of the current work were to assess the antioxidant and antimicrobial effect of walnut kernel septum membranes hydroalcohol extract (WHE) in traditional butter (TB). Antioxidant characterization of the extract was screened through methods of DPPH, reducing power and total phenolic assays. After preparation of traditional butter from yogurt, WHE was incorporated into TB at three different concentrations; 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.5% and compared with a control, BHT and tocopherol treated samples (200 mg of BHT and tocopherol/kg). Microbiological studies (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, Coliforms, Psychrotrophic bacteria, yeasts and molds) were done during 90 days of storage time. Changes in Anisidine value (AV), acid value, peroxide value (PV) free fatty acids (FFA), Schaal and Totox value were monitored at 45-day intervals. Sensory evaluation was done using 10 semi-trained panelists based on the 5-point hedonic scale.</p><p>It was found that the total phenolic content of WHE was 368.86 mg GAE/g. The BHT had higher antioxidant activity than WHE inhibiting 92.3% of the DPPH radical at 600 &#x003bc;g/mL. Peroxide value of TB treated with tocopherol, BHT and WHE 0.5% was 0.29 &#x000b1; 0.07, 0.39 &#x000b1; 0.07 and 0.52 &#x000b1; 0.04 respectively. Furthermore, the WHE incorporated butter has shown low levels of free fatty acids, Schaal and Totox value when compared to control treatment. The WHE 0.5% incorporated sample had the most antimicrobial activity and it inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms (except <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) used in the study. Among the treated TB, the samples treated with the control and WHE 0.05% had the highest sensory attributes score. The study showed that WHE could be an excellent natural origin of antimicrobial and antioxidant agents which can be used in butter.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keyword</title><kwd>Food science</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Butter with 80&#x02013;83% lipid contents is an important edible fat in most countries of the world (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mofid et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). This dairy product is one of the main complexes of every dietary fats, containing further 400 different fatty acids (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Papadopoulou and Roussis, 2008</xref>). In Iran, the traditional butter (TB) locally is obtained after milk fermentation by churning and in this way the fat content concentrates about 20 times. Since butter is kept for a lengthy time, sensory attributes can transform owing to oxidative rancidity as a result of oxygen catalyzed by lipases from microorganisms or food. At the first step of oxidation, the reaction involving unsaturated fatty acids leads to the configuration of peroxides with a resultant reduction in the safety caused by the formation of secondary toxic compounds. Oxidation eventually leads to formation of a rancid flavor and decreases the economic and nutritional value of fats (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ozkan et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Lipid oxidation may be expeditiously retarded when antioxidants are present. Synthetic antioxidants for instance butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) as well as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) at concentrations ranging from 50-500 ppm in butter are appropriate in the protection of fats, thus, are applied as suppressors of oxidative reaction (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Nadeem et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). However, their usage have been asked because of their toxicity, hence today the quest for developing natural antioxidants has increased. Using natural antioxidants is considered as anti-food borne bacteria and a great opportunity for the oxidative stabilization of milk products (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ozkan et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Among the different sources of natural antioxidants, walnuts (<italic>Juglans regia L.</italic> family <italic>Juglandaceae</italic>) are rich in compounds with potent antioxidant and antibacterial activity such as tocopherols and polyphenols (gallic acid and ellagic acid), tannins and melatonin (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tapsell, 2010</xref>). Production of walnuts is almost 1,500,000 Tons and the United States, China, Iran, Turkey and Ukraine are the main producers of walnut. Different parts of it such as kernel, leaves and septum have a significant antioxidant effects. It has been recognized that about 50 g of walnuts contains further entirety of phenolics than about 240 ml of apple juice or even a milk chocolate (43 g) (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Miraliakbari and Shahidi, 2008</xref>). Polyphenols have been recognized to be capable of disturbing the activities of enzymes concerned in the generation of reactive oxygen species, chelating transition metals (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Besides antioxidant activity, numerous researches confirmed the antimicrobial activity of phenolic extracts such as walnut extract (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Sousa et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), making them a good option to synthetic preservatives. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ajaiyeoba and Fadare (2006)</xref> reported that African walnut has antibacterial and antifungal activities linked to phenolic compounds against <italic>Staphyloccocus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>), coliforms and molds. <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ajaiyeoba, Onocha, Nwozo, and Sama (2003)</xref> showed that the chloroform, methanol, hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the kernel extract of walnut displayed good antimicrobial activities which were concentration-dependent.
