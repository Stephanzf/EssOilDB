    "Curcuma longa (turmeric) is commonly used as spice and also used to treat fever, cough and febrile convulsions in Nigeria. This study determined the chemical composition of the essential oil of C. longa and evaluated its neuropharmacological activity in mice.Essential oil of C. longa (EOCL) fresh rhizome was obtained by hydrodistillation and its chemical composition determined by GC-MS. Acute toxicity (LD50) profile of the essential oil was determined orally (p.o.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.); and the EOCL (50-200 mg/kg, i.p.) was evaluated for its behavioural, anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant activities using appropriate models in Albino mice (Vom Strain, Jos, Nigeria).Analysis of the oil showed the presence of 23 compounds with turmerone (35.9%) being the major component. The LD50 values obtained for the mice were 2154 mg/kg, p.o., and 693 mg/kg, i.p. The EOCL (50-200 mg/kg, i.p.) caused significant (p < 0.01) inhibition of rearing {F(4,20) = 9} and locomotor {F(3,16) = 42} activity; decreased head dips in hole board {F (4,20) = 4}; increased the time spent in the open arms of the elevated pus maze {F (4,20) = 9}; prolonged total sleeping time {F (4,20) = 21} induced by ketamine injection, and protected mice against pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions.The major component of the essential oil of this C. longa species was turmerone; the oil was slightly toxic orally but moderately toxic intraperitoneally in mice; exhibited significant anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant activities in mice."
