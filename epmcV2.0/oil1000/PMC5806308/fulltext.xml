This may also be linked to the difference in the chemical composition, especially the presence of eugenol, since aromatic alcohols are mainly responsible for the antimicrobial activity of essential oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Some authors have mentioned that the antimicrobial action of essential oil is due to the lipophilic character of its hydrocarbon skeleton and the hydrophilic character of its functional groups; the chemical group with higher antimicrobial activity is phenol, followed by aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, and hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A higher antimicrobial activity has been reported for phenolic compounds such as thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol, which is associated with the acidic nature of the hydroxyl group, forming a hydrogen bond with an enzyme active center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Concerning the volatile compounds in the essential oil from the <italic>micranthum</italic> species, some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] used the GC-MS analysis to identify majority compounds such as &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (27%), methyl eugenol (14%), eugenol (12%) and in lower percentages, spathulenol (3%) and caryophyllene oxide (3%). Also, the authors identified compounds with antimicrobial activity in the ethanolic extract such as eugenol (18%), &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (6%), benzoic acid (3%), methyl eugenol (2%), dodecanoic acid (2%) and spathulenol (1%). Finally, in the aqueous extract eugenol (59%), 2,2-dimethyl-4-(methylethyl)-2H&#x02013;imidazole, (4%), phenethyl alcohol (2%), methyl eugenol (2%) and catechol (1%) were identified, compounds that have shown antimicrobial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the present study, the ethanolic extract showed a bacteriostatic effect and a fungistatic effect at lower concentrations than the aqueous extract, despite having the lowest content of eugenol, thus it is possible that the antimicrobial properties of the ethanolic extract may be attributed to a synergic effect between its compounds.</p><p id="Par51">The behavior of the ethanolic extract in the MTT assay can be predicted from the MIC test where a fungistatic effect on <italic>Candida albicans</italic> at a low concentration (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L/mL) was observed; this fungus is a microorganism of eukaryote origin as the cell lines that were used in MTT assay. This behavior may be associated with the chemical nature of the extract, specifically a possible synergic effect of its compounds, because this extract has a lower percentage of eugenol, a phenolic compound with high antimicrobial activity and antiproliferative activity on cancer cells. Eugenol has been shown to be a molecule capable of exerting an antiproliferative effect on diverse cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], however, it does not seem to be the determinant compound in the antiproliferative behavior of <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> extracts, since the aqueous extract exerted this effect at higher concentrations, despite containing a higher content of eugenol than the essential oil and the ethanolic extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">All results obtained in the Trypan blue assay were coherent with the visual observations made under the microscope, while this did not occur with the results of the MTT test. Also, through visual inspection, the cytotoxic effect of the extracts on hFB cells was observed.</p><p id="Par53">In general, in the MTT assay, the antiproliferative effect on the human fibroblast cell line was underestimated when high concentrations of the extracts from <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> Willd were tested. The results also suggest that the measurement of the antiproliferative or proliferative effects of the phytochemicals contained in the extracts may vary between a colorimetric method (MTT assay) and a method that involves the direct counting of viable cells such as the Trypan blue assay. This difference is probably associated with the interaction of diverse chemical components in the extracts (such as the phenolic compounds) with the MTT reagent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; it is possible that these types of compounds may interfere with critical formazan formation in the MTT method.</p><p id="Par54">In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], it was observed that natural compounds with intrinsic reductive potential such as some flavonoids, phytoestrogens and ascorbic acid might lead to false positives in the MTT assay, due to a mechanism of non-enzymatic reduction of the MTT to formazan. Other authors have reported that changes in the metabolism of the cells may induce an increase in the reduction of the MTT to formazan, which has been observed as an increase in the coloration of the reaction, hence in the values of absorbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">In the comparison of the three extracts, it was observed that the underestimation of the antiproliferative effect was more notable in the essential oil, which may be related to a synergic effect of some volatile compounds with antioxidant characteristics present in the extract such as eugenol, methyl eugenol and other compounds including isoborneol, eucalyptol, spathulenol, a profile of volatile compounds that have been previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].
