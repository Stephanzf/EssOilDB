Plants were cultivated in semiarid soil under four different fertiliser treatments (composts of anaerobic digested cattle (C) or pig slurry (P) at 30t/ha and 60 t/ha, and two control treatments (inorganic fertiliser and no fertiliser application). Samples of leaves and stems were analysed to investigate the effect of treatment on chemical composition and thermochemical properties. Three orthogonal analytical approaches were used, namely: Fourier transform mid infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and thermochemical gravimetric analysis (TGA). FTIR and GC/MS showed fertiliser treatment resulted in tissue specific changes in sample metabolite composition. Fertiliser treatment was detected to change the thermogravimetric properties of the leaf samples and from inorganic and composted pig slurry digestate treatments had greater ash content and lower proportions of fixed carbon compared with samples from the unfertilised control treatment. This study provides information on how the composition of rosemary might be altered by fertiliser application in regions of poor soil, and has implications for biomass quality when rosemary is grown on semi-wild sites for the purpose of soil improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Plant sciences</kwd><kwd>Plant physiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>EC | Seventh Framework Programme (EC Seventh Framework Programme)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>284443</award-id><award-id>284443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>M.

The species also has economic importance and is cultivated widely for essential oil production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The essential oils of <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> are used in a diverse range of industry sectors including the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors, and there is considerable interest in their health related e.g. antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Rosemary also has a role in soil rehabilitation in Mediterranean regions where it is grown to alleviate soil erosion. Since it is drought-tolerant it grows on soils ranging from rocky to sandy, providing sites have adequate drainage and a minimum soil depth of about 0.2&#x02009;m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, rosemary can be planted for the phytostabilisation of soils contaminated with heavy metals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and its growth and oil composition are relatively unaffected by growth on heavy-metal contaminated soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Several studies have investigated the effect of growth conditions on rosemary yield and essential oil composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and their results implicate fertiliser application and dose as important agronomic factors. However, very few studies have been reported of the effect of fertiliser type and application rate on the characteristics of rosemary plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and these studies mainly focused on yield and oil quality. Several groups have reported that the use of fertilisers and/or amendments may alter vegetal cell wall content and composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, but there is little or no knowledge of the effect of organic fertilisers on the composition of rosemary. Primary and secondary metabolites are the intermediate or ultimate products of complex networks of biochemical pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, whose functioning depends on substrates availability and/or enzyme activities, which at the same time are highly dependent on micro and macronutrient availability. As organic fertilizers are sustained sources of nutrients due to slow release during decomposition, soil nutrients are more available to plants over the time. Changes in macronutrient availability (e.g. N, P and K) indeed has a direct effect on metabolism, since macronutrients are directly involved in essential cellular processes, and in many cases the biosynthesis of important organic molecules e.g. proteins, nucleic acids, co-enzymes, phytohormones and secondary metabolites. Even elements that at first inspection would appear to be required in only very small amounts i.e. the micronutrients e.g. Mn, Fe, Zn and Cu, can have major influence on tissue composition and metabolism due to their requirement as cofactors for enzyme activity.</p><p id="Par4">The methods used in this study all provide rich data on different aspects of sample composition, and are therefore orthogonal and complementary in nature. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is a fast and accurate technique widely used to characterise a great variety of biological and chemical samples. The strength of the technique lies in the combination of exceptional chromatographic resolution of chemical components in the sample coupled to mass spectral information that directly reflects molecular structure. The robustness and reproducibility of GC/MS has favoured adoption of GC/MS for many metabolomics studies, in which complex multivariate chemical relationships between samples are detected by multivariate data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) also provides complex chemical data on sample composition, and mid-IR spectra informs of chemical bonds present in pure samples. Whilst it is possible to quantify primary and secondary metabolite concentrations in samples and tissues using regression models {Allison, 2011 #57;Schulz, 2005 #41;Allison, 2009 #2;Allison, 2009 56}. Lastly, we have used thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to provide information on mass-fraction i.e. moisture, volatile and fixed carbon content as samples are heated in the absence of oxygen. TGA has been used to characterise organic wastes and composts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, lignocellulose composition and energy grass feedstock quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and the technique provides valuable information on the kinetics of thermal decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We have used these methods to provide orthogonal, chemically meaningful data for chemometric analyses to visualise chemical/compositional relationships between samples and thereby investigate the effect of fertiliser dose and type on rosemary plants in a global context. This study aims to increase our understanding of the likely compositional effects of organic fertiliser application on rosemary crops and on populations grown in semi-wild regions for the purpose of soil stabilisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characteristics of the soil and organic amendments</title><p id="Par5">The soil used in this study was obtained from the surface layer (0&#x02013;20&#x02009;cm) of a semiarid agricultural area, abandoned for a period of ten years in Montelibretti, a town in the Metropolitan City of Rome, in Lazio (Italy). Before being abandoned, the area had been under intensive agriculture for more than 20 years. The soil was air dried before being passed through a 2&#x02009;mm sieve. The soil from this site is a highly calcareous loam soil, that is slightly alkaline (pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.6), and has low salinity (0.10 dS/m) and poor total organic C content (0.75% C).</p><p id="Par6">The composts used in this study comprised of solid fractions from the anaerobic digestion of cattle and pig slurry (75% by dry mass of digested cattle slurry (compost C), or digested pig slurry (compost P) respectively) mixed with 25% by dry mass of vine shoot prunings. The anaerobic cattle and pig digestates used were obtained after a continuous, mesophilic anaerobic digestion of 4.3% cattle manure and 11.6% maize oat silage (fresh mass basis) and of pig slurry, respectively. Compost C was prepared at semi-industrial scale (1800 kg) by the Rutgers static pile composting system, while compost P was prepared in a thermo-composter (150&#x02009;kg) by the turning composting system. During composting, both mixtures reached temperature values higher than 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which guarantees the sanitization of the composts.

Fifty cuttings had been prepared for this purpose from a single parent plant. The cuttings were each approximately 5&#x02009;cm long and immediately after removal from the parent they were stripped of their lower leaves, dipped into a hormone-containing rooting powder, planted in rooting pots with peat, and maintained in a greenhouse for a period of two months whist rooting took place. After this period, plants of similar length were selected and carefully re-potted in the treatment pots, which were distributed in a randomised complete block design inside a heated greenhouse. The cutting roots were carefully washed with distilled water to remove any particles attached before being planted. All of the pots (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;36) were maintained for six months at a controlled temperature of 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Watering of the pots was monitored gravimetrically and maintained at 50% of field capacity throughout the experiment.

A similar observation was reported by Fernie and Urbanczyk-Wochniak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, in a study of tobacco plants under different nitrogen regimes. In this case, levels of fructose, galactose, raffinose and sucrose were not clearly related to nitrate nutrition. Furthermore, the changes in carbohydrate abundance depending on the N availability (saturation or deficiency) seemed to be tissue-specific and dependent on the carbohydrate species, since the behaviour observed was different for each carbohydrate. This fact was also reported in the leaves and roots of tomato under plants grown under nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium-deficient condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and in leaves from pak choi plants grown in a soil amended with composts of different origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The concentration of other types of compounds, phenolic compounds (eg caffeoylquinic acid, galactopyranoside, hydrocaffeic acid) also presented different responses to the different soil treatments and that might be partly due to the various nitrogen contents of these composted digestates. At this regard, Neugart <italic>et al</italic>. (2018) have recently concluded that nitrogen might not be the only factor influencing the leaf concentration of monoacylated kaempferol glycoside in plants grown on soils amended with three different composts. Several studies, for example, have reported 2-oxoglutaric acid (synonyms &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, 2-ketoglutaric acid, or 2-oxoglutarate) to have an important role as a key regulator at the intersection between the carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Fernie and Urbanczyk-Wochniak (2004)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> observed large decreases in 2-oxoglutaric acid in tobacco plants grown on limited nitrogen supply. On the other hand, Sung <italic>et al</italic>. (2015) related the low levels of 2-oxoglutaric acid found in leaves of tomato plants to P deficiency. In our experiment, higher levels of this metabolite appeared associated to the low dose of composted pig slurry digestate and the inorganic treatment, which can be ascribable to the higher availability of nitrogen and phosphorus in these treatments, especially in the inorganic treatment. 2-oxoglutaric acid and glutamate are key regulators of amino acid biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, and our observation of increased concentrations of 2-oxoglutaric acid on high-nitrogen treatments is in agreement with other studies that reported this component to be increased, together with a wide group of amino acids, under conditions of nitrogen saturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>TGA proximate analysis</title><p id="Par37">Plant biomass contains large amounts of the cell wall components hemicellulose, cellulose, pectin, and lignin, together with primary and secondary metabolites proteins storage polymers such as starch and lipid. Analysis of plant material by thermogravimetry means provides information on the thermal stability of the various chemical components in the samples and in this study, insight into changes in composition effected by different fertilizer treatments. The calculation of mass fraction in the samples due to moisture, volatiles, fixed carbon and ash is called proximate analysis. Sample pyrolysis generally takes place in a non-oxidising atmosphere to avoid the occurrence of combustion, and the process can be divided into three stages with regards to weight loss and temperature. The first stage occurs between 30 to 120&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with maximal mass loss occurring at about 110&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. During this stage, moisture evaporates from the samples. The second stage occurs between approximately 200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 600&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and is attributable to loss of labile or volatile components of the biomass. The cell wall components hemicellulose, pectin and cellulose thermally decompose at these temperatures together with other labile metabolites and polymers. Cellulose has greater thermal stability and woody samples often show biphasic mass loss during this stage of thermal decomposition. The mass remaining after the loss of volatiles is classified as char, and mostly this is comprised of condensed lignin together with the inorganic fraction of the biomass. The amount of fixed carbon in the samples can be calculated by subtraction of the weight of ash from the weight of char<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par38">Proximate analysis of the samples revealed differences in thermal decomposition between the two tissues in the region corresponding to loss of volatiles. The rate of mass loss for the leaf samples was less than that observed for the stem samples, although ultimately more mass was lost from the leaf samples during analysis, indicating greater volatile content in the leaf samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Differential plots of these data (DTG curves) showed the leaf samples had a more complex thermal decomposition compared to the stem samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), probably due to the presence of a greater amounts of thermally labile metabolites and storage polymers. Whilst the leaf and stem samples displayed maximal mass loss (Tmax) at very similar temperatures (355&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 346&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for stem and leaf samples respectively), the leaf samples showed additional mass loss events at 289&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 435&#x02009;&#x000b0;C that were less evident in derivative plots of the stem samples.

Changes in metabolite composition are most likely brought about by N availability, and whilst the differences detected were tissue and metabolite specific, no clear trends relating concentration and fertiliser regime were apparent. Higher concentrations of 2-oxoglutaric acid were associated with the low dose of composted pig slurry digestate and the inorganic treatment, probably due to the higher availability of nitrogen in these treatments, especially in the inorganic treatment. Proximate analysis of the leaf and stem samples revealed differences between the two tissues in the thermal decomposition of the volatile fraction. Moreover, TGA data from the leaf showed that fixed carbon was decreased in samples treated with either inorganic fertiliser or composted pig slurry digestate). Lastly, differences in volatile fraction thermal stability were detected between leaf samples treated with either inorganic or composted pig slurry digestate compared with control and composted cattle manure digestate treated leaves.</p><p id="Par48">Thus, this study provides new insight into metabolic and chemical changes in rosemary plants responding to different fertilising treatments. Furthermore, it demonstrates the value of taking a multidisciplinary approach when studying plant response to changes in growing conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
