This seaweed synthesizes various bioactive molecules, one of them being a sulfated polysaccharide known as fucoidan (FF). This polymer can easily be found commercially, and has antiadipogenic and lipolytic activity. Using differential precipitation with acetone, we obtained four fucoidan-rich fractions (F0.5/F0.9/F1.1/F2.0) from FF. These fractions contain different proportions of fucose:glucuronic acid:galactose:xylose:sulfate, and also showed different electrophoretic mobility and antioxidant activity. Using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found that all samples had lipolytic action, especially F2.0, which tripled the amount of glycerol in the cellular medium. Moreover, we observed that FF, F1.0, and F2.0 have antiadipogenic activity, as they inhibited the oil red staining by cells at 40%, 40%, and 50%, respectively. In addition, they decreased the expression of key proteins of adipogenic differentiation (C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2;, and PPAR&#x003b3;). However, F0.5 and F0.9 stimulated the oil red staining at 80% and increased the expression of these proteins. Therefore, these fucoidan fractions have an adipogenic effect. Overall, the data show that F2.0 has great potential to be used as an agent against obesity as it displays better antioxidant, lipolytic and antiadipogenic activities than the other fucoidan fractions that we tested.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>3T3-L1 cells</kwd><kwd>fucan</kwd><kwd>lipolytic</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>brown seaweed</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-marinedrugs-16-00193"><title>1. Introduction</title><p><italic>Fucus vesiculosus</italic> is a brown seaweed commonly found in coastal wetlands, in temperate or cold waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It was shown that <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic> intake helps women with abnormal menstrual cycles, and health problems associated with their periods [<xref rid="B1-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Other author also reported that consumption of this seaweed promotes a decrease in body weight [<xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This seaweed has various active elements in its composition, of which fucoidan is one of the best known.</p><p>The presence of fucoidan in <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic> was demonstrated in 1913, and was initially called fucoidin [<xref rid="B4-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Years later, it was suggested that the term be changed to fucoidan [<xref rid="B5-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The structure of fucoidan (FF) from <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic> was last reviewed by Patankar et al. [<xref rid="B6-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It was suggested that it possesses a central core formed by &#x003b1;-L-fucose (1,3)-linked, sulfated at C4. In addition, several branching points (every two or three fucose residues) were present in &#x003b1;-(1,2) or &#x003b1;-(1,4)-linked, on the main chain.</p><p>Currently, it is easy to acquire fucoidan from <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic>, as a multinational company sells it commercially. In part, this may explain the large amount of research and the number of activities ascribed to this sulfated polysaccharide, including antilipemic [<xref rid="B7-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and antiadipogenic activities [<xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Adipogenesis is a process of cell differentiation in which mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into adipocytes, with this process initially involving a stage where cells &#x0201c;compromise&#x0201d; with the adipocyte line [<xref rid="B11-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the next step, differentiation occurs, and the pre-adipocytes develop into mature adipocytes. The process of differentiation is complex and involves the participation of hundreds of proteins, although two proteins particularly play a crucial role in this event: C/EBP&#x003b1;, a protein of the CCAAT-enhancer binding protein class, and PPAR&#x003b3;, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor [<xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Although pre-adipocyte primary cultures are an important tool for understanding the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation, these cells have low mitogenic capacity and lose their ability to differentiate over time under culture conditions [<xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, the development of studies on adipogenesis is carried out mainly by the use of cellular models, such as the murine 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A (pre-adipocyte) lines. These cells, when stimulated to differentiate into adipocytes, follow the same metabolic pathways of differentiation of mesenchymal cells [<xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>By using a differentiation cocktail based on insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and fetal bovine serum, it is possible to obtain mature adipocytes from a 3T3-L1 culture. The actions of these compounds result in the initial events of differentiation, represented by the expression of CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins [<xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Afterwards, the cells return to their cell cycles, undergo clonal expansion in a regulated manner, and enter a terminal differentiation process by activation of PPAR&#x003b3; and C/EBP&#x003b1; [<xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Besides, the differentiation of these cells takes place in precisely controlled sequential stages: cell cycle arrest, clonal expansion, and differentiation (first phase and second phase of activation of transcriptional factors), by activating hundreds of previously silenced genes [<xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Studies with pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells showed that fucoidan from <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic> inhibits adipogenesis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data showed that fucoidan reduced mRNA expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3; by 22.6% and 17.6%, respectively [<xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>FF from <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic> can be fractionated, with certain fractions showing very similar activities to each other [<xref rid="B10-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, Nishino et al. [<xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that some fucoidan fractions showed much greater activity than others did. However, antiadipogenic activity across different fucoidan populations has not yet been evaluated. With this in mind, we obtained four different fucoidan-rich fractions of commercial fucoidan from <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic> and, assessed them for their adipogenic activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-marinedrugs-16-00193"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-marinedrugs-16-00193"><title>2.1. Obtaining Different Fractions of Fucoidan (FF) </title><p>Using differential precipitation with acetone, we obtained four fractions from FF. These were called F0.5, F0.9, F1.1, and F2.0 corresponding to 4.5%, 35.2%, 22.0% and 38.3% of the material, respectively (<xref rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Chemical analysis and sulfated polysaccharide yield are summarized in <xref rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Data show that mannose and glucose were not found in the samples, whereas fucose, glucuronic acid, galactose and xylose were found in all samples. The data also showed fucose was the major component present in all fractions, whereas the relative amounts of other monosaccharides vary according to the fraction. Thus, the relative amounts of these sugars vary according to the fraction.</p><p>When the sulfate content of the samples was quantified, it was observed that there is no significant difference between F1.1 and F2.0. Although F1.1 and F2.0 both have the same sulfate content, they were precipitated with different volumes of acetone. This is probably because the sulfated polysaccharide conformation interferes during the precipitation process.</p><p>To confirm this hypothesis, the fucoidan-rich fractions were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in 1,3 diamineacetate (PDA) buffer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows an agarose gel stained with toluidine blue. It is possible to see that all the fractions have a predominant band.

Antioxidant Activities</title><p>The antioxidant activity of samples was evaluated in vitro by the total antioxidant capacity test (TAC). All samples showed antioxidant activity, though the values were significantly different from each other, particularly for F2.0 fucoidan, which was approximately 400 &#x000b1; 12.0 equivalents of ascorbic acid. This is nearly double the values obtained for FF and F0.9, which were 189 &#x000b1; 10.0 and 172 &#x000b1; 11.0 ascorbic acid equivalents, respectively. The value identified for F1.1 was found to be significantly lower than the two mentioned above (150 &#x000b1; 8.0 equivalents). The value obtained for F0.5 was around 38 &#x000b1; 2.0 equivalents, the lowest recorded in this study. There was positive Pearson correlation coefficient between the sulfated content of fractions and TAC (<italic>P</italic> = 0.566).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-marinedrugs-16-00193"><title>2.3. 3T3-L1 Cell Viability</title><p>As the 3T3-L1 line (pre-adipocytes) is the main cell model used for the study of adipogenesis, it was first necessary to assess the effects of the samples on the viability of these cells. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f002">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Over a period of 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), it was observed that there was a reduction in cell viability (~30%) when the cells were cultured in the presence of FF, F0.5, and F0.9 at the highest concentration tested (1000 &#x000b5;g/mL). A similar effect was observed after 48 h. On the other hand, cytotoxicity (decrease in MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenil tetrazolium bromide) reduction by 20%) was also identified using F0.5 at lower concentrations (100 and 200 &#x000b5;g/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The cytotoxic effects observed with the use of F0.5 was more pronounced after 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f002">Figure 2</xref>C), since there was a decrease in the MTT reduction by 40%, 48%, and 64%, using F0.5 in concentrations of 100, 200, and 1000 &#x000b5;g/mL, respectively. The same was also observed with the use of FF, F1.1, and F2.0 (all at 1000 &#x000b5;g/mL), when there was a decrease in MTT reduction of ~55%. Thus, a concentration of 200 &#x000b5;g/mL was selected for use in the following tests relating to the antiadipogenic effects of fucoidans.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-marinedrugs-16-00193"><title>2.4. Evaluation of the Antiadipogenic Effects of Samples</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows that samples had different effects on adipocyte differentiation. As shown in the images below, FF, F1.1, and F2.0 were able to reduce the amounts of neutral lipids within cells, a fact evidenced by the reduced labeling of the cells.</p><p>To confirm what was observed by optical microscopy, the oil red O was eluted from the inside of the cells and quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f004">Figure 4</xref>). As the oil red O dye has an affinity for neutral lipids (triglycerides), the more fat (triglycerides) that is accumulated in the adipocyte the greater the amount of dye within the cell and vice versa. Thus, it was observed that FF induced an approximately 40% reduction of triglyceride in the cells. F2.0 reduced the amount of triglyceride within the adipocytes by approximately 50% and this effect was more pronounced than that observed for FF. An unprecedented result was observed with F0.5, which induced the accumulation of oil red by approximately 80% more than the control group.</p><p>To understand the biochemical mechanisms by which these fucoidans act, the expression of key proteins of adipogenesis: C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2;, and PPAR&#x003b3; of the 3T3-l1 cells was evaluated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows an immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f005">Figure 5</xref>A) of these proteins. The results obtained from the densitometry of this blot are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f005">Figure 5</xref>B.</p><p>The expressions of these three proteins were altered when the cells were incubated with fucoidans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). F0.5 and F0.9 mainly stimulated the expression of C/EBP&#x003b2; and PPAR gamma. However, F2.0 reduced the expression of all three proteins evaluated herein, particularly for C/EBP&#x003b2; and PPAR&#x003b3;, by approximately 55% when compared to the control. In regards to F1.1, we take special note of the particularly strong reduction of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression. These data are in agreement with the oil red test and confirm that F0.5 and F0.9 are adipogenic agents, while F2.0 and F1.1 are antiadipogenic agents.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-marinedrugs-16-00193"><title>2.5. Evaluation of the Effects of Samples on Lipolysis </title><p>In order to evaluate the potential of the samples to induce lipid hydrolysis in adipocytes, specifically in triglycerides, free glycerol in the culture medium from untreated cells (control), and from cells treated with the fucoidans (200 &#x000b5;g/mL) was quantified. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f006">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f006">Figure 6</xref>, all samples induced lipolysis. F0.5 was able to induce the mobilization of triglycerides after only 15 days of differentiation, while F0.9 showed a discreet effect by the ninth day of differentiation and after 15 days of culture. Twice as much glycerol in the medium of cells treated with F0.9 than for the control group was found. F1.1 needed only nine days of differentiation to achieve such an effect, i.e., double the lipolysis in comparison with the control group, with this potential being maintained throughout the differentiation process. In turn, F2.0 showed the strongest lipolytic effect, as it was able to increase the breakdown of triglycerides by three times after only nine days of differentiation. Despite the slight decrease in its potential to induce lipolysis during the differentiation process, we also observed 2.5 times more glycerol in the medium of the cells treated with F2.0 than in the control group at the end of the test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-marinedrugs-16-00193"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Using differential precipitation with acetone, we acquired four different fractions of commercial fucoidan (FF) from <italic>Fucus vesiculosus</italic>. Other fucoidans were also separated into different fractions by the use of acetone, such as fucoidan from <italic>Spatoglossum schr&#x000f6;ederi</italic> [<xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], <italic>Dictyopteris delicatula</italic> [<xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and <italic>Dictyota menstrualis</italic> [<xref rid="B20-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Acetone separates the different polysaccharides because it competes with them for water molecules. Therefore, the smaller the interaction of the polysaccharide with water, the smaller the amount of acetone that should be added to the solution to precipitate it. Generally, the interactions between sulfated polysaccharides and water partly depend on the amount of charges on the polysaccharide, with the least negatively charged being the first to be precipitated.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows that fucoidans fractions have different electrophoretic mobilities. In this electrophoresis system, the buffer used (PDA) includes 1,3-diaminopropane in its constitution, which is positively charged at pH 9.0. These positively charged buffers are able to link with the negatively charged groups of the polysaccharides that are exposed, such as sulfates, thus neutralizing them. However, the formation of this complex depends not only on the negatively charged groups of the sulfated polysaccharide, but also on the spatial conformation that the molecule takes in the system, and the effects that it has on how the sulfated polysaccharide exhibits its charged groups. Therefore, the amines do not form complexes with all sulfate groups, but only those that are exposed. In this way, the polysaccharide&#x02019;s mobility depends on the sulfate groups that have not formed complexes. A classic example is the behavior of chondroitin and heparin, two sulfated polysaccharides that are structurally similar, although heparin is more strongly sulfated. However, in the electrophoresis system with PDA, heparin has a much lower electrophoretic mobility than chondroitin [<xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In a previous study it was shown that commercial fucoidan was composed of fucose, glucose, galactose, mannose, xylose, glucuronic acid and sulfate [<xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Of these monosaccharides we find neither glucose nor mannose in FF. This is probably because the composition of commercial fucoidans should vary. So, we also did not find these two monosaccharides in the fractions. In addition, the relative proportion of glucuronic acid, xylose and galactose was different in each sample. Overall, these data lead us to propose that we have obtained four different fucoidan-rich fractions from <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic>.</p><p>Qi et al. [<xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] suggested that the antioxidant activity of fucoidan is related to the degree of sulfation: the more sulfated the polysaccharide, the more active it is. However, the data from the TAC test did not agree with those suggested by these authors. In addition, there was a weak Pearson correlation coefficient between the sulfated content of fractions and TAC. Furthermore, the data submitted by various authors that evaluated the antioxidant capacity of fucoidans obtained from other brown seaweed [<xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] indicate that the structure of fucoidans, as well as the exposure of the oxidizable groups along the molecule, are more important factors for the antioxidant capacity of these polymers than the number of sulfate groups.</p><p>The antiadipogenic activity of the fucoidan (FF) from <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic> had previously been reported [<xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the fucoidan fraction constituents of FF have not yet been evaluated in isolation for their antiadipogenic potential. In this work, we observed that these fractions had different effects on adipocyte differentiation.</p><p>Since oil red O has an affinity for neutral lipids (triglycerides), the greater the amount of fat (triglycerides) accumulated within adipocytes, the more dye will be observed within that cell, and vice versa. FF promoted a reduction of triglycerides in cells of around 40%. This value was highly similar to that observed by other authors, for example by Kim et al. [<xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In 2009, they reported that a commercial fucoidan was able to reduce the incorporation of oil red O by adipocytes in 39.7%, at a concentration of 200 &#x003bc;g/mL [<xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An unprecedented result was observed for F0.5 and F0.9, which induced the accumulation of triglycerides to approximately 80% more, compared to the control group. On the other hand, F2.0 fucoidan reduced the amount of triglycerides within adipocytes by approximately 50%, with this effect being more pronounced than that observed using FF.</p><p>To better understand the biochemical mechanism by which these fucoidans act, we verified the expression of key regulatory proteins of adipogenesis: C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2;, and PPAR&#x003b3;, as it has been reported that commercial fucoidan affects these enzymes [<xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In agreement with the results of the oil red O test, F0.5 and F0.9 caused an acute increase, mainly in the expression of C/EBP&#x003b2; and PPAR&#x003b3;, in comparison to the control, confirming that these two compounds are adipogenic agents. However, F1.1 and F2.0 caused a reduction in the expression of these proteins, which in turn led to a reduction in the amount of triglycerides inside the adipocytes, as observed in the oil red O test.</p><p>The effects caused by fucoidans on gene expression and adipogenesis regulatory proteins have been previously reported in the literature, corroborating our results. FF was reported to reduce preadipocyte differentiation in adipocytes by reducing the expression of certain genes, including <italic>PPAR&#x003b3;</italic> [<xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and <italic>C/EBP&#x003b1;</italic>, by 22.6% and 17.6%, respectively [<xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>F1.1 and F2.0 were able to induce the release of triglycerides from the interior of the adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00193-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The molecular pathways by which these fucoidans act was not suggested, but fucoidan is known to stimulate the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase (LSH) [<xref rid="B8-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. LSH regulates lipolytic activity within adipocytes, and the phosphorylation of this enzyme leads to its activation with consequent hydrolysis of the triglycerides stored inside these cells, which subsequently release their glycerol and fatty acids [<xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that the LSH activation pathway may be the target of fucoidan activity demonstrated in our work. We intend to investigate this hypothesis in future work.</p><p>Anti-obesity drugs, besides causing a series of undesired effects, may possibly contribute to the onset of cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, the search for new agents that are effective against obesity and present lower health risks remains a priority [<xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-16-00193" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Chemical analyzes showed fucose was the major component present in all fractions whereas the relative amounts of other monosaccharides vary according to the fraction. Monosaccharide composition, agarose gel electrophoresis, and antioxidant data showed that each fraction had a different type of fucoidan. F0.5 and F0.9 have an adipogenic effect because they stimulated the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through up-regulation of C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2;, and PPAR gamma. On the other hand, F1.0, and F2.0 have antiadipogenic activity. In addition, all samples had lipolytic action, especially F2.0, which tripled the amount of glycerol in the cellular medium. Among these, F2.0 showed a marked effect on the attenuation of lipid accumulation, antioxidant, and lipolytic activities, and we thus recommend it as a natural antiadipogenic agent for several biotechnological applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico-CNPq, CAPES, PROCAD, Ciencias do Mar-CAPES, and the Minist&#x000e9;rio de Ci&#x000ea;ncia, Tecnologia, Inova&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e Com&#x000e9;rcio-MCTIC (Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology, loose translation) for the financial support.
