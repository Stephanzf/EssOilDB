    "This study aims to investigate the characteristics of oleogel (OG) produced from amaranth oil at four concentrations of 7%, 9%, 10%, and 12% of the monoglyceride (MG). The physicochemical and structural aspects were performed by using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and gas chromatography. The results show that oleogels (OGs) had higher oxidative stability during storage at ambient temperature in comparison with amaranth oil. Moreover, polarized optical microscopy revealed that an increase in percentage of the oleogelator leads to the formation of needle-shaped crystals followed by oil entrapment. Also, MG improves the solid content of amaranth oil from 0.5% to 11% and creates a solid structure in spite of the low solid fat as compared to cocoa butter (CB) (82%), as control sample. Crystals similar to CB were also observed when evaluating the crystalline structure of the OG. The fatty acid ratio and the essential linoleic fatty acid were preserved in the OG by only 2%-6% reduction."
