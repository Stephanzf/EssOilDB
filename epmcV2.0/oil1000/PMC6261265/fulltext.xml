Based on four plastidic markers, we can define several haplotypes within <italic>Ocimum</italic> that are consistent across these markers. Haplotype II is congruent with <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic>, while haplotype I extends over several members of the genus and cannot be resolved into genetically separate subclades. The vernacular subdivision of Tulsi into three types (Rama, Krishna, Vana) can only be partially linked with genetic differences&#x02013;whereby Rama and Krishna Tulsi can be assigned to <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic>, while Vana Tulsi belongs to haplotype I. This genetic difference is mirrored by differences in the profiles of secondary compounds. While developmental state and light quality modulate the amplitude to which the chemical profile is expressed, the profile itself seems to be linked with genetic differences. We finally develop an authentication assay that makes use of a characteristic single nucleotide polymorphism in one of the barcoding markers, establishing a differential restriction pattern that can be used to discriminate Vana Tulsi.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91643072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rios Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was not specifically funded except a Ph.D. fellowship to Daniela Rios Rodriguez from the German Academic Exchange Service (91643072).

Observations in wild chimpanzees that make use of specific herbs for healing and transmit this habit by individual education [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] suggest that phytotherapy has been a central factor during the cultural evolution of humans from its very beginning. Based on the importance of plants for human culture, it is easy to understand that traditional nomenclature is predominantly shaped by human usage of plants. This functional context of vernacular plant names is often incompatible with scientific taxonomy that attempts to reflect (more or less successfully) phylogenetic relationship. This conflict had been exemplarily investigated using the case of the Tzeltal, an ethnic community of native Americans in Mexico [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] leading to the noteworthy conclusion that folk names tell &#x0201c;<italic>&#x02026;nothing about the structure of nature itself</italic>, <italic>but a great deal about our own view of this structure</italic>.&#x0201d;</p><p>The discrepancy between traditional and scientific nomenclature often goes unnoticed, so long as a given plant remains in its traditional functional context. However, in the very moment when this plant is shifted into a novel functional context, these discrepancies become highly problematic for quality control and consumer protection in the importing countries.</p><p>Three examples may suffice to illustrate this point: The traditional Mesoamerican oil crop &#x02018;Chia&#x02019; is currently booming as so called &#x0201c;super food&#x0201d; in Europe and is defined as <italic>Salvia hispanica</italic> L. by the EU Novel Food Regulation [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, in their region of origin, the name &#x02018;Chia&#x02019; (in the languages of the native Mesoamericans meaning just &#x0201c;oily&#x0201d;) is used for six different plants; some of them, such as <italic>Amaranthus caudatus</italic>, belong to completely different plant families [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ambiguities of vernacular names can also lead to drastic misdeclaration of commercial products as found recently for Bamboo tea (designated as <italic>Dan Zhu Ye</italic> in Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM). Many samples did not contain any Bamboo, but rather the leaves of a Chinese species of carnation, which in China is also known as &#x0201c;Stone Bamboo&#x0201d; (<italic>Shi Zhu</italic>) and should not be consumed by pregnant women because it activates uterine contractions [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. So far, the most serious consequence of misunderstood vernacular taxonomy is the case of <italic>han fangchi</italic> (<italic>Aristolochia fangchi</italic>) which had been traded to Europe as (guan) fangchi (<italic>Stephania tetrandra</italic>), with the consequence that more than 100 women in Belgium lost their kidneys as a result of consuming a TCM based slimming therapy [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>It is evident that problems caused by the ambiguities of vernacular taxonomy will be accentuated progressively as a consequence of economic globalisation. Already in the 1990s, the international trade volume for pharmaceutical plants was estimated to exceed 400 000 tons per year [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a number which will have increased in the years since and does not consider the extensive proportion of medicinal plants that are directly consumed in their country of origin. Consumer safety is further deteriorated by deliberate replacement of medicinal plants by cheaper, but often inactive, substitutes&#x02013;a problem that in combination with a rapidly growing internet trade, has become a major concern for a substantial proportion of commercially traded medicinal plants [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The mandate for consumer safety requires that vernacular names are properly assigned to scientific taxonomy. However, despite useful endeavours, e.g. the Kew Garden website for Medicinal Plant Names (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mpns.kew.org/">http://mpns.kew.org</ext-link>), a Babel Fish [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] for medicinal plant nomenclature is still to be invented. This metaphor for a translation device illustrates the problem: there is no bidirectional relation in the &#x0201c;translation&#x0201d; of vernacular into scientific nomenclature, since the vernacular nomenclature is context dependent.</p><p>If the commercial declaration of traded medicinal plants must be treated with caution for the reasons mentioned above, we need methods to monitor the authenticity of traded materials. These methods should be fast, easy, and reliable. The traditional authentication of processed plant samples by microscopic diagnostics requires considerable experience and skill, and is often limited by processing, which destroys the morphological features required for determination. Chemical analysis of characteristic secondary compounds, for instance by thin layer chromatography, is frequently used for authentication, but can be misleading when the sample has deteriorated during storage or transport, or when the diagnostic compound had not accumulated in consequence of environmental fluctuations during cultivation. During the last decade, polymorphisms in specific DNA sequences, so called genetic barcodes, have attracted considerable attention, because they allow authentication of organisms based on their genotype, and, therefore, independently from tissue, environment, or developmental state.</p><p>The international Consortium for a Barcode of Life (CBOL) has investigated different marker sequences for their suitability as barcodes for different organisms. In addition to nuclear markers, such as the internal transcribed spacers of the <italic>rRNA</italic> genes, sequences from organelle genomes are used because they are present in multiple copies and are therefore abundant in total DNA extracted from plant material. Since mitochondrial barcodes, which are prevalent in animal molecular taxonomy, show low substitution rates in plants, barcoding of land plants frequently employs plastid markers. These markers were systematically tested with respect to different criteria, such as universality, variability between different taxa, amenability to sequencing, and the presence of sequence motifs that are conservative enough to allow the design of universal primers, but on the other hand flank sequence regions that are variable enough to be informative [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. From this study, two regions in coding genes (<italic>1</italic>,<italic>5-ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase Large subunit</italic>, <italic>rbcL; maturase K</italic>, <italic>matK</italic>), and one intergenic spacer (<italic>trnH-psbA IGS</italic>) were found to be the most powerful single-locus barcodes. However, compared to the discriminative power of animal barcodes, the resolution of these plant barcodes remains limited&#x02013;while the resolution is sufficient to discern genera, these barcodes are often not able to discriminate down to the species level, because the variation within a species often exceeds the taxon gap between species [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>A model case for the conflict of vernacular and scientific nomenclature is represented by the Basils (genus <italic>Ocimum</italic>). From molecular phylogeny, the origin of the genus can be inferred to be tropical Asia [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with the centre of diversity in the Indian subcontinent. The Basils are probably the medicinal plants with the longest documented tradition spanning around four millennia with first records dating to the Vedic scripts. As might be expected from such a long and intricate history of human use, the traditional nomenclature of the Basils (Tulsi, Tulasi) is complex, ambiguous, and, in the last consequence, not projectable on to any scientific taxonomy. On the other hand, the trading volume is, with around 100 t of essential oils per year, quite considerable [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Depending on their appearance and use, the Tulsis are differentiated in a kind of binomial nomenclature&#x02013;for instance, the dominant form, called Rama Tulsi, is used for religious purposes and usually &#x0201c;translated&#x0201d; as <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> L. [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The purple Krishna Tulsi, named after its resemblance to the colour of the Hindu deity Krishna, is preferred for medical use and also assigned to <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> L. [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, Rama Tulsi (synonymous with Sri Tulsi), probably due to its importance for worship, is sometimes assigned to (the now outdated) <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sanctum L</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A third type, Vana Tulsi (the meaning &#x0201c;forest&#x0201d; Tulsi may indicate that it is often collected in the wild), is mostly &#x0201c;translated&#x0201d; as <italic>O</italic>. <italic>gratissimum</italic> L. [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] although it is also used as a name for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>canum</italic> (an outdated name for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>americanum</italic> L., [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). There is a whole cosmos of additional types of Tulsi that partially stand for other species of <italic>Ocimum</italic>, such as Babui Tulsi for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>basilicum</italic> L. [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] that can also appear as Kali Tulsi [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while Kala Tulsi stands for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>americanum</italic>, but in the same source [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is also used as a synonym for Sri Tulsi, while Ram Tulsi is also used for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>gratissimum</italic> L. Only a few species, such as <italic>O</italic>. <italic>kilimandscharicum</italic>, which was brought to India from East Africa, seem to carry a traditional name (Kapur Tulsi from the Hindi word for camphor) that is unequivocal. The <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> type of Tulsi might even show further differentiations, because for certain treatments, such as the expelling of worms or wound healing, a form of Tulsi is prescribed that is called Surasaadi [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Now, this highly ambiguous traditional nomenclature hits a global market, where Tulsi is praised as an &#x0201c;adaptogen&#x0201d; for the stressed Westerner [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and traded in continuously increasing amounts. This conflict of nomenclature will inevitably culminate in serious problems for quality control and consumer information. The situation is complicated further by the fact that several chemovars exist that strongly differ in their composition of essential oils&#x02013;for instance, commercial use discriminates between a methyl-cinnamate, a camphor, and a citral chemotype of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>americanum</italic>, while for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>basilicum</italic> four different chemotypes are described [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it is not clear, to what extent these chemical differences are determined by genetics (&#x0201c;nature&#x0201d;), and to what extent by differences in the environment (&#x0201c;nurture&#x0201d;).</p><p>We therefore addressed the question, whether chemical diversity (underlying the medical effect of Tulsi), and genetic diversity (as detectable by genetic barcodes) can be assigned, and to what extent the traditional differentiation of Tulsi into Rama, Krishna, and Vana Tulsi correlate to genetic differences that can be used for molecular authentication in commercial samples exported from India.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material, cultivation, and light conditions</title><p>The study was built around a collection of <italic>Ocimum</italic> established in the Botanical Garden of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, which had been raised to the flowering stage and identified based on taxonomical keys [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For the subtypes of Tulsi, seeds from plants that have been validated by trained Ayurvedic herbalists (Pukka, Bristol, UK) were used. To avoid ambiguities caused by the numerous synonyms for <italic>Ocimum</italic> species, only the accepted names given in the Botanic Garden, Kew Plant List (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.theplantlist.org/">http://www.theplantlist.org/</ext-link>) are used throughout. Internal accession ID and source, identity after morphological authentication, and Genbank accession numbers of the sequences isolated from these accessions are given in <bold><xref rid="pone.0207763.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>. Two commercial samples were also included in the study. Sample 1 was declared as a mixture between Rama Tulsi, Krishna Tulsi, and Vana Tulsi, while sample 2 was declared as a mixture between Rama Tulsi (<italic>O</italic>. <italic>sanctum</italic>), Krishna Tulsi (<italic>O</italic>. <italic>sanctum</italic>), Vana Tulsi (<italic>O</italic>. <italic>gratissimum</italic>) and cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. For the analysis, sample 1 was used directly, while for sample 2, the non-foliar components were sorted out. Plants were cultivated in individual pots, on a commercial white peat clay substrate (Floraton 3, Floragard, Oldenburg, Germany). All genotypes were raised in parallel in the greenhouse at a temperature of 22&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0;C during daytime, and 18&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0;C during the night. The light period was 16 h &#x000b1; 2 h at around 108 &#x003bc;M<sup>.</sup>sec<sup>-1.</sup>m<sup>-2</sup> &#x000b1; 30 &#x003bc;M<sup>.</sup>sec<sup>-1.</sup>m<sup>-2</sup> of photosynthetically available radiation at the Botanical Garden of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (49.008681 N, 8.403886 W).

The frozen material was ground using a high-throughput disruptor (TissueLyser, Qiagen, Germany), and the DNA extracted using the InnuPrep Plant DNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel) following the instructions of the producer. Quality was controlled spectrophotometrically (Nano-Drop 1000, peQLab) and by gel electrophoresis. The genomic DNA (50 ng template) was then subjected to a PCR using primers for different plastidic barcoding markers (details are given in <bold><xref rid="pone.0207763.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>) with an initial denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C, 30 sec annealing at 60&#x000b0;C, and 60 sec synthesis at 68&#x000b0;C using a conventional Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt). Final elongation was 5 min at 68&#x000b0;C. Amplicons were then separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis at constant voltage of 100 V, results were documented by a digital gel documentation system using the fluorescence of SYBRSafe as label.

The alignments were trimmed and then used to construct phylogenetic trees either based on the Neighbour-Joining algorithm (model: maximum composite likelihood with uniform rates) or the Maximum Likelihood (model: Tamura-Nei with uniform rates, using Nearest Neighbour Interchange as heuristic algorithm to infer the tree), and bootstraps derived from 1000 replicates, again making use of the MEGA phylogenetic software.

Supernatants were separated using HP-TLC and analysed for the patterns of flavonoids or of essential oils, respectively. Aliquots of 10 &#x003bc;L for each sample were loaded as 8-mm bands on a 200 mm x 100 mm HPTLC glass plate (Si 60 F<sub>254</sub>, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using an Automatic TLC Sampler (ATS4). After development in an Automatic Development Chamber (ADC2) under standardised conditions (20 min chamber saturation, 33% humidity with magnesium chloride, development distance of 70 mm from lower edge, drying time 5 min), the plates were derivatised by dipping (5 cm/s, dwell time 0 s, Immersion Device) and documented using the Visualizer. The HPTLC equipment was made by CAMAG, Muttenz Switzerland, and the <italic>vision</italic>CATS software 2.3 (CAMAG) was used for instrument control and data acquisition. Choice of standards, as well as developing solvents and derivatisation reagents were dependent on the respective group of compounds. For the essential oils standard solutions of eugenol (0.5 mg/mL), methyleugenol (0.5 mg/mL), and ursolic acid (0.25 mg/mL) in methanol were used as System Suitability Test (SST) and toluene/ethyl acetate (85/15) as developing solvent.

For flavonoids, standard solutions of rutin (0.5 mg/mL), hyperoside (0.125 mg/mL), and rosmarinic acid (0.5 mg/mL) in methanol were used as SST and development was conducted in ethyl acetate/water/formic acid (15/1/1). For derivatisation, the plates were preheated for 3 min at 100&#x000b0;C and then derivatised with natural product reagent (0.5% w/v of 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate in ethyl acetate) and subsequently with PEG reagent (5% w/v of polyethylene glycol in dichloromethane).

Also, haplotype I was further differentiated into subgroups (although with relatively low bootstrap support and not assignable to a specific species).

Alternatively, the chemical differences might derive from environmental factors independent of genotype. In fact, the different chemotypes found in the Basils are traditionally interpreted as resulting from cultivation in different areas rather than having a genetic basis [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, this has never been addressed by systematic experimentation. We therefore raised different genotypes side by side under different light qualities and then profiled two groups of bioactive fractions by HP-TLC&#x02013;the water-soluble flavonoids, and the lipophilic essential oils. In a preparatory study, where the three types of Tulsi were compared through development (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207763.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>), we observed that the profile of flavonoids was strongly dependent on developmental stage, whereby the abundance of compounds increased with the age of the plant. As expected, the abundance of flavonoids in commercial samples of the same accessions (that had been raised under the tropical sun of India) was higher than in plants raised in the greenhouse. However, despite these modulations, the profile of &#x02018;Vana Tulsi&#x02019; remained clearly distinct from that seen in &#x02018;Rama Tulsi&#x02019; or &#x02018;Krishna Tulsi&#x02019;. Thus, while the expression of the compound pattern clearly varied depending on developmental stage and cultivation conditions, the pattern itself was constant for a given genotype. In the next step, we compared flavonoid profiles (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>) and essential oil profiles (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>) for different accessions of <italic>Ocimum</italic>. Despite an overall congruence of these patterns, there were specific bands, where the accessions differed clearly. For instance, in the flavonoid fingerprint two blue fluorescent bands at R<sub>f</sub> ~ 0.6 were characteristic for accessions belonging to haplotype I as defined in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>. Interestingly, this band was also seen in &#x02018;Vana Tulsi&#x02019; (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). Conversely, a green fluorescent band at R<sub>f</sub> ~ 0.2 was seen in accessions belonging to <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> (including &#x02018;Rama Tulsi&#x02019; and &#x02018;Krishna Tulsi&#x02019;) and <italic>O</italic>. <italic>campechianum</italic>, but was weak or even absent in accessions from haplotype I as well as in &#x02018;Vana Tulsi&#x02019;. Overall, the flavonoid profile could be matched to the genetically defined haplotypes. The essential oil pattern also showed accession-dependent differences (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>).

This was systematically tested by raising the plants side by side under equal fluence rates of light but under light of different spectral composition. In addition to conventional white light, we tested white light complemented with red and blue light, which should not only activate chlorophyll (this was excluded by keeping the photosynthetically available radiation constant throughout all parallels of this experiment) but would also activate type-II phytochromes (red light) as well as type-I phytochromes (blue light). A third set used white light complemented with long-wavelength UV-A (365 nm) to activate cryptochromes, and a fourth set with white light complemented with short-wavelength UV-B (310 nm) should active the UVR8 receptor. While we were able to see certain modulations in the flavonoid patterns (for instance, in &#x02018;Krishna Tulsi&#x02019; a yellow band at R<sub>f</sub> ~ 0.18 became upregulated under UV-B, i.e. under conditions, where anthocyanin expression in most plants is most active), the profile of flavonoids remained unaltered (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>), which was also true for the pattern for essential oils (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). The plants were clearly responsive to the changes in light quality, as was visible from the differences in the density of oil glands for different light qualities (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). Here, the different genotypes were not only different in terms of overall ability to produce glandular scales, but also in terms of wavelength dependency and responsiveness to altered light quality.

Rama Tulsi and Krishna Tulsi belong to the <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> haplotype, while the third type, Vana Tulsi, belongs to haplotype I, although it cannot be assigned to any of the four recognised species in this cluster. This genetic difference is mirrored by differences in the profiles of secondary compounds. Developmental state and light quality can modulate the amplitude to which the chemical profile becomes manifest, possibly linked with different, light-quality dependent responses in the development of oil glands. Nevertheless, the profile itself seems to be relatively hard-wired, as seen by the robust difference between Vana Tulsi and the other two (Rama, Krishna) types of Tulsi.

While the classical Linnean concept of species as morphologically distinct groups of individuals has been mostly replaced by concepts in which genetic relationship and gene flow are used to define a species, the debate about what species actually are and how we can delineate them is ongoing (for a comprehensive discussion of current species concepts see [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). In the context of &#x0201c;biological species&#x0201d; that are defined by genetic barriers, hybridisation of species, i.e. the successful breakage of these barriers, must represent the exception to the rule. However, it becomes increasingly clear that hybridisation is a powerful driving force for speciation reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This is particularly relevant for plants, where genetic barriers are much more permeable than in animals. The Lamiaceae, with an estimate of some 7000 species, have so far remained recalcitrant to a consistent taxonomy&#x02014;Lindley&#x02019;s <italic>bonmot</italic> of the &#x0201c;<italic>state of confusion</italic>, <italic>that has been gradually increasing since the days of Linnaeus</italic>, <italic>until it has become the disgrace of Botany</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] has basically remained valid. One reason may be the fact that species barriers are maintained here mainly by differences in flower morphology that provide a certain (but by no means a secure) channelling of gene flow. A classic example is the role of the pollination lever in the sympatric speciation of Central European <italic>Salvia</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Changes in the geometry of sexual organs leading to hybridisation are a likely event and are expected to generate a more or less reticulate field of different &#x0201c;species&#x0201d;. In this context, the diffuse clustering of four <italic>Ocimum</italic> species into haplotype I is what would be expected, while the fairly robust delineation of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> into a separate haplotype is a phenomenon that demands further explanation.</p><p>Plastidic markers are generally thought to be inherited exclusively through the maternal germ line, based on different mechanisms such as mitotic exclusion of plastids or plastid degeneration in the sperm cells [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, around 20% of tested Angiosperms show biparental inheritance of plastids based on different mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Whether biparental inheritance is active in <italic>Ocimum</italic> is not known. It cannot be excluded, since one of the showcases where plastidic biparental inheritance has been demonstrated is a different member of the Lamiaceae, <italic>Nepeta cataria</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, without further evidence, the claim to demonstrate the hybrid nature of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>citriodorum</italic> (a synonym for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>x africanum</italic>) using plastidic markers [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] seems inappropriate. Thus, the tight separation of the <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> haplotype from the other <italic>Ocimum</italic> species <italic>per se</italic> cannot rule out that pollen from <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> can fertilise flowers from haplotype I, nor that haplotype I pollen can fertilise a <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> flower. (These events would not leave any trace in the plastidic genome in case of maternal plastid inheritance). However, we can state that the distinct/discrete haplotype differences are found in all four tested loci of the chloroplast genome, indicative of a relatively long history of divergence, while the divergence of the different &#x0201c;species&#x0201d; within haplotype I seems to be much shorter (or not even at a stage, where it has become irreversible).</p><p>However, there is evidence for a different mechanism of reproductive isolation: A careful study based on karyotyping, flow-cytometric determination of DNA content, and nuclear markers [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] support a scenario, where <italic>O</italic>. <italic>basilicum</italic> are tetraploids deriving from an ancestor with 12 chromosomes, while <italic>O</italic>. <italic>americanum</italic> and <italic>O</italic>. <italic>x africanum</italic> are hexaploids. <italic>O</italic>. <italic>x africanum</italic> can produce viable offspring with some accessions of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>basilicum</italic> indicative of a still incomplete genetic barrier [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic>, has a much smaller genome which seems to derive from a hypopolyploid event, where the basal number of chromosomes had been reduced to 9. This would provide a straightforward explanation for the very tight genetic divergence of haplotype II (<italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic>), in contrast to the rather promiscuous pattern seen between the species forming haplotype I. &#x02018;Vana Tulsi&#x02019;, while clearly clustering with haplotype I, nevertheless differs from any of the tested species in this cluster and from its morphology rather resembles the accessions of haplotypes II and III, indicative of a certain degree of reproductive isolation&#x02013;it might therefore be promising to investigate this type of Tulsi by cytogenetics to search for marks of incipient speciation, for instance in consequence of a hybridisation event. It is recognised that the plastidic markers used in the current study are not suited to detect hybridisations. Nuclear barcoding markers such as the internally transcribed sequences ITS1 and ITS2 might allow further resolution. Results from our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] indicate that these markers allow further differentiation within haplotype I, and we are currently including additional accessions to obtain more solid data in support of this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Steps towards molecular authentication of different Tulsi types</title><p>In the current work, we have explored the potential of barcodes for authentication of ambiguous plant material for the sake of consumer safety and product transparency. For commercial application, discriminative power is not sufficient as criterion. Robust amplification success or accessibility for sequencing are further criteria that must be met. In our hands, two of the markers, <italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>trnH-psbA</italic>, show the best potential for commercial application. While <italic>rbcL</italic> was the marker which was most easily amplified (for instance, if compared to <italic>matK</italic>), its relatively high degree of conservation represents a certain drawback. Therefore, the <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> barcode seems to provide a good compromise between robust amplification and discriminative power. This is consistent with the experience of others, and in fact, the introduction of this marker into the British Pharmacopoeia to authenticate <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic> represents the first example of a DNA barcode as a trait in industrial quality assurance [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Despite the prospects for industrial applications, there is still a long way to go until molecular markers can be used routinely&#x02013;the regulatory and technical issues have been comprehensively reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For instance, many of the traded products contain mixtures of different plant species, parallel processing of a large number of samples by PCR poses the challenge that even minute contamination can be amplified creating false positive results and DNA quality in what are often processed samples may become limiting. A further drawback of authentication by barcoding is the need to generate and analyse the sequences before a conclusion on the identity of the sample can be made. This is time consuming and requires expertise in handling sequence information, which conflicts with the requirements of practical use, where large number of samples may have to be checked in a short time to decide whether they can be released for trading. Fingerprinting methods, such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (using arbitrary primer pairs to generate a banding pattern) are convenient at first sight, because they do not require any working hypothesis. However, the reliability of these markers for authentication is limited as shown by systematic validation testing in the Brassicaceae [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The reason is mainly that the relatively low annealing temperatures for these arbitrary primers can generate non-specific amplification products. Also, bands of equal size do not necessarily originate from the same template but are treated as if they were. Alternative markers, such as inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), allow for a better resolution as compared to the plastidic barcodes [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, for the same reasons as for RAPD (low annealing temperatures, ambiguous assignment of banding patterns), the ISSR approach can have reproducibility issues [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which may be tolerable in a taxonomic study, but strongly conflicts with the needs of consumer protection.</p><p>Assays to authenticate commercial samples must meet three central requirements: they have to be fast, they have to be easy, and they have to be reliable. Our approach, targeting a restriction polymorphism of the <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> marker, meets these requirements. We exemplarily applied this strategy to two commercial samples declared to contain mixtures of &#x02018;Rama&#x02019;, &#x02018;Krishna&#x02019;, and &#x02018;Vana Tulsi&#x02019;, (which was declared as <italic>O</italic>. <italic>gratissimum</italic>) and could show that the declaration of &#x02018;Vana Tulsi&#x02019; as <italic>O</italic>. <italic>gratissimum</italic> was wrong.</p><p>A similar restriction-based strategy (using the <italic>rbcL</italic> marker) has been used successfully to authenticate two species that are used in the traditional medicine of the Australian Aborigines but now traded under the same vernacular name, Lemon Myrtle [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Alternatively, the sequence differences can be used to design specific destabilised oligonucleotide primers that will only bind one target, but not the other and can be added to the conventional barcoding primers. This so-called Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) will thus yield a diagnostic side band in addition to the full-length amplicon. Using this strategy, it is possible to discriminate the Moldavian Dragonhead (<italic>Dracocephalum moldavica</italic>) from Cat Mint (<italic>Nepeta cataria</italic> L.) and Common Melissa (<italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L.), species that are often used as surrogates [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Likewise, adulteration of Medicinal Bamboo Tea by a species of Chinese Carnation in Germany could be detected using the ARMS approach [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Which of these alternative strategies can be applied, depends on the particular sequence motifs. Compared to the restriction-based assay, the ARMS approach is faster. Moreover, the full-length amplicon in addition to the diagnostic side band provides an inbuilt control for the success of the PCR [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Outlook</title><p>Making use of sequence differences in the barcoding marker <italic>trnH-psbA</italic>, we were able to discriminate different types of the medicinal plant Tulsi and to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of Vana Tulsi (haplotype I) versus Rama and Krishna Tulsi (haplotype II). Further, we developed a simple and rapid assay to discriminate these types of Tulsi based on a differential restriction site in this marker. Although this assay can contribute to improved transparency, because it highlights differences which align to vernacular designations of commercial products, further progress in discriminative resolution would be desirable. Given the impact of genome remodelling during the evolution of <italic>Ocimum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], duplications in gene families would be one of the options&#x02013;a principle exploited in Tubulin-Based Polymorphism, a strategy with high resolutive power [<xref rid="pone.0207763.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For instance, the practice to commercialise Tulsi in complex mixtures with other Ayurvedic plants clearly illustrates the limitation even of <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> as trait-independent marker. For practical applications, it is the chemical specificities that matter. Our observation that the compound profiles seem to be based on genetic differences, while environmental conditions (light quality) and development instead modulate the degree to which these profiles become manifest, provides a good starting point to develop trait-related markers that would discriminate specific chemotypes of <italic>Ocimum</italic>. This would also allow authentication of target species in a mixed sample without the need for demanding approaches such as high-throughput genomics of commercial samples.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0207763.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Molecular relationships inferred from the RubisCo large subunit (<italic>rbcL</italic>) marker using the data set shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g002">Fig 2</xref> and two alternative algorithms (neighbour joining versus maximum likelihood).</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0207763.s001.TIF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0207763.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Molecular relationships inferred from the <italic>matK</italic> marker.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Evolutionary relationship of 64 sequences for the <italic>matK</italic> marker from <italic>Ocimum</italic>, along with one sequence from <italic>Nepeta cataria</italic> and <italic>Hanceola sinensis</italic>, respectively, used as outgroups inferred using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm.
