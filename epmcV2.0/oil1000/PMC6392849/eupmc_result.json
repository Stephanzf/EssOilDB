    "Two sorghum genotypes termed Wad-Ahmed (high tannin) and Tabat (low tannin) in Sudan were fermented with different starter levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of fermented baobab fruit pulp flour (FBFPF). Chemical composition, antinutrients, extracted minerals, and the microbiological, physicochemical, functional, rheological, and pasting properties from the fermented flours were determined. Fermentation of both genotypes with higher levels of FBFPF starter enhanced protein, fiber, ash, and major mineral contents and extractability (p ≤ 0.05). Total acidity, bulk density, rheological properties, in vitro protein, and starch digestibility of both genotypes increased with FBFPF levels, with a concomitant decrease in pH, phytate and tannin contents, and water and fat absorption capacities (p ≤ 0.05). Microbial loads, especially lactic acid bacteria, increased with increasing FBFPF starter levels in both genotypes. Use of FBFPF as a starter in the fermentation of sorghum flour can improve the nutritional value of sorghum. This could be usefully applied to the food industry for the development of fermented sorghum products."
