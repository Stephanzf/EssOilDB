    "Reverse osmosis (RO) system at a stage after membrane bioreactor (MBR) is used for the wastewater treatment and reclamation. One of the most serious problems in this system is membrane fouling caused by biofilm formation. Here, microbiomes and chemical components of the feed water and membrane-attached biofilm of RO system to treat MBR effluents were investigated by non-destructive confocal reflection microscopy, excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The microscopic visualization indicated that the biofilm contained large amounts of microbial cells (0.5 ± 0.3~3.9 ± 2.3 µm3/µm2) and the extracellular polysaccharides (3.3 ± 1.7~9.4 ± 5.1 µm3/µm2) and proteins (1.0 ± 0.2~1.3 ± 0.1 µm3/µm2). The spectroscopic analysis identified the humic and/or fulvic acid-like substances and protein-like substances as the main membrane foulants. High-throughput sequencing showed that Pseudomonas spp. and other heterotrophic bacteria dominated the feed water microbiomes. Meanwhile, the biofilm microbiomes were composed of diverse bacteria, among which operational taxonomic units related to the autotrophic Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava and Blastochloris viridis were abundant, accounting for up to 22.9 ± 4.1% and 3.1 ± 0.4% of the total, respectively. These results demonstrated that the minor autotrophic bacteria in the feed water played pivotal roles in the formation of polysaccharide- and protein-rich biofilm on RO membrane, thereby causing membrane fouling of RO system."
