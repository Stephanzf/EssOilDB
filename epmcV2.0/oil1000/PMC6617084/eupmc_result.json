    "In this study, natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) were used as both the extraction and dilution matrix in static headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SHS-GC-MS) for the analysis of volatile components in Ipomoea cairica (L). Sweet (ICS) leaves. Six NADESs were prepared and the NADESs composed of choline chloride and glucose with a 1:1 molar ratio containing 15% water were preferred due to the better peak responses. A total of 77 volatiles in ICS leaves were detected and tentatively identified by mass spectral matching with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, 2014) Mass Spectral Library and the retention index-assisted qualitative method. These 77 volatile components were mainly terpenoids, aromatics, and aliphatics. Among them, β-elemene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and 2, 4-di-tert-butylphenol were found to be the main components. This investigation verified that the use of NADESs is an efficient green extraction and dilution matrix of the SHS-GC-MS method for direct volatile component analysis of plant materials without extra extraction work."
