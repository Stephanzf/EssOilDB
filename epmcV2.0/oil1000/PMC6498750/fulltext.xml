<italic>Cocos nucifera</italic> (coconut palm) is a member of the Arecaceae family, being widely grown in tropical and subtropical regions as an economically important plant, accounting for 1.8% of the global vegetable oil market with production of 3.2 million metric tonnes per year (<xref rid="pcy247-B152" ref-type="bibr">OECD 2017)</xref>. The coconut palm is well known for its ability to accumulate and store large amounts of oil, approximately 65% of the seed weight (<xref rid="pcy247-B39" ref-type="bibr">Laureles et&#x0fffd;al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B24" ref-type="bibr">Gunstone et&#x0fffd;al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B38" ref-type="bibr">Kumar 2011</xref>). In physiochemical terms, coconut oil varies significantly from other vegetable oils as it is rich in saturated fatty acids (93%) with 85% of these being medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA; C8&#x02013;C16), predominantly lauric (C12:0) and myristic (C14:0) acids. Oils that are rich in lauric acid exhibit characteristics that are important for application within both the food and chemical industries including increased oxidative stability, low melting points and the ability to produce stable emulsions (<xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr">Arkcoll 1988</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B38" ref-type="bibr">Kumar 2011)</xref>. Currently, lauric oils are used in the manufacture of soaps, detergents, textiles, paints, varnishes, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products and are also used within the food industry (<xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr">Arkcoll 1988</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B39" ref-type="bibr">Laureles et&#x0fffd;al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B38" ref-type="bibr">Kumar 2011</xref>). Lauric oils, are produced by only two industrially important species being coconut palm and <italic>Elaeis guineensis</italic> (African oil palm), both being limited to growth in tropical and subtropical climates. The large investment required and the long wait before the palms yield a return of profit is discouraging the establishment of new plantations (<xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr">Arkcoll 1988</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B6" ref-type="bibr">Basiron 2007</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B11" ref-type="bibr">Carter et&#x0fffd;al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B45" ref-type="bibr">Murphy 2007)</xref>, and is also a major driver for the development of new MCFA-producing crops that can be grown in more temperate climates.</p><p>The unique composition of coconut oil raises interest in understanding how the coconut palm produces oil of a high saturated MCFA content, and if such an oil profile could be replicated in another species via biotechnology interventions. To date, there has been limited success in a variety of species. In transgenic <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (canola) seeds, high lauric acid content has been achieved to a peak of 67% (<xref rid="pcy247-B15" ref-type="bibr">Dehesh et&#x0fffd;al. 1996)</xref> with the co-expression of a class B fatty acid thioesterase (<italic>FATB</italic>) from <italic>Umbellularia californica</italic> (California bay laurel; <italic>UcFATB</italic>) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase from coconut palm (<italic>CnLPAAT</italic>). More recently, transcriptomic analyses have enabled the identification of <italic>FATB</italic> and <italic>LPAAT</italic> genes from many <italic>Cuphea</italic> species (cigar plant), which have been used to both modify the fatty acid profiles and improve the incorporation of MCFA into the triacylglycerol (TAG), respectively, of transgenic <italic>Camelina sativa</italic> seeds (<xref rid="pcy247-B33" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x0fffd;al. 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B34" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x0fffd;al. 2015b</xref>). However, during seed development the laurate content in phosphatidylcholine (PC) increases, suggesting that there is a bottleneck in the efficient utilization of lauric acid during oil synthesis. This concept has also been demonstrated in attempts to accumulate unusual fatty acids in the seed oils of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="pcy247-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bates and Browse 2011)</xref>. In the high-laurate canola lines, laurate levels in PC remained high (up to 26%) until the late stages of TAG deposition (<xref rid="pcy247-B68" ref-type="bibr">Wiberg et&#x0fffd;al. 1997)</xref>. The subsequent work from <xref rid="pcy247-B36" ref-type="bibr">Knutzon et&#x0fffd;al. (1999)</xref> showed that the addition of the <italic>LPAAT</italic> from coconut (<italic>CnLPAAT</italic>), although specific for the acylation of laurate to the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), did not reduce the flux of laurate into PC. We hypothesize that the MCFA content of transgenic oils may be influenced through the specificity and activity of biosynthetic enzymes. Therefore, better manipulation of fatty acid and oil biosynthesis pathways will be essential for improving the performance of MCFA accumulation in transgenic oils. The discovery of genes involved in the assembly of MCFA-enriched oils is an important step forward in achieving this. However, such efforts have been hindered by the limited genomic resources available.</p><p>In prospect of improving the MCFA content of oils the identification of genes involved in TAG assembly were of particular interest, specifically MCFA-specific acyltransferases. Although <italic>LPAAT</italic> from coconut palm (<xref rid="pcy247-B37" ref-type="bibr">Knutzon et&#x0fffd;al. 1995</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B36" ref-type="bibr">Knutzon et&#x0fffd;al. 1999</xref>) and many <italic>Cuphea</italic> species (<xref rid="pcy247-B33" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x0fffd;al. 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B34" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x0fffd;al. 2015b</xref>) have previously been identified and characterized, other MCFA-specific acyltransferases remain unknown. The <italic>AtGPAT9</italic> (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) was recently identified and was demonstrated to have functions in both initiating TAG assembly through the mediation of <italic>sn</italic>-1 esterification and increasing TAG content (<xref rid="pcy247-B59" ref-type="bibr">Shockey et&#x0fffd;al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B61" ref-type="bibr">Singer et&#x0fffd;al. 2016)</xref>. The final step of TAG assembly through the Kennedy pathway involves the esterification of a third fatty acid to the <italic>sn</italic>-3 position of G3P, which is performed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase (<italic>DGAT</italic>). <italic>DGAT</italic> has been shown to exhibit variations in substrate specificity (<xref rid="pcy247-B23" ref-type="bibr">Frentzen 1998</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B16" ref-type="bibr">Durrett et&#x0fffd;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B17" ref-type="bibr">Dussert et&#x0fffd;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B3" ref-type="bibr">Aym&#x0fffd; et&#x0fffd;al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B4" ref-type="bibr">Aznar-Moreno et&#x0fffd;al. 2015</xref>), and hence has a significant contribution towards the final fatty acid composition of plant oils. Recent transcriptomic analyses have enabled the identification of a new <italic>DGAT</italic> gene from <italic>Cuphea avigera</italic> var <italic>pulcherrima</italic>, <italic>CpuDGAT1</italic>, which was combined with the expression of <italic>CvFatB1</italic> and <italic>CvLPAT2</italic> to achieve high levels of C10:0 incorporation in the oils of transgenic <italic>C.sativa</italic> seeds (<xref rid="pcy247-B30" ref-type="bibr">Iskandarov et&#x0fffd;al. 2017)</xref>. Another acyltransferase that contributes to TAG synthesis is phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (<italic>PDAT</italic>), which uses DAG as the substrate and PC as the fatty acid donor for TAG production (<xref rid="pcy247-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dahlqvist et&#x0fffd;al. 2000)</xref>. Thus the involvement of acyltransferases in both the efficient production of oil and the tailoring of fatty acid composition makes these important targets for the improvement of MCFA oils.</p><p>
<italic>Oleosins</italic> have also become an attractive target of metabolic engineering in the production of stable oils in transgenic plants, particularly for non-seed platforms for the production of oil (<xref rid="pcy247-B65" ref-type="bibr">Vanhercke et&#x0fffd;al. 2014a</xref>). They stabilize oil by covering the surface of lipid droplets and protect against the degradation by lipases (<xref rid="pcy247-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh and Huang 2004</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B44" ref-type="bibr">Maurer et&#x0fffd;al. 2013)</xref>. Oleosin proteins contain a hydrophilic N-terminus, a central hydrophobic stretch of 72 residues and a hydrophilic C-terminus. The central stretch of 72 hydrophobic residues is the hallmark of oleosins as no other protein contains such a long hydrophobic stretch. Another key feature of an oleosin protein is the formation of the proline-knot in the center of the long hydrophobic region that forms via the interaction of one serine and three proline amino acid residues (<xref rid="pcy247-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh and Huang 2004)</xref>. Based on the high oil content of the seeds from the coconut palm (67%) (<xref rid="pcy247-B49" ref-type="bibr">Padolina et&#x0fffd;al. 1987</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr">Arkcoll 1988</xref>), it was hypothesized that <italic>oleosins</italic> must be playing an integral role in the accumulation and maintenance of the oil.</p><p>Recent gene discovery studies of coconut palm have focused on identifying genes involved in yield, with transcriptomes built using material from leaves and mature fruits (H. <xref rid="pcy247-B20" ref-type="bibr">Fan et&#x0fffd;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B28" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x0fffd;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B27" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x0fffd;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B41" ref-type="bibr">Liang et&#x0fffd;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B47" ref-type="bibr">Nejat et&#x0fffd;al. 2015)</xref>. Consequently, there is still a significant gap in knowledge associated with the oil biosynthesis pathways in coconut palm. In this study, an RNA-Seq approach was used to build a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome from developing coconut endosperm. This transcriptome was utilized to identify and isolate genes involved in the synthesis of lipids, particularly TAG. It was hypothesized that some of these genes may exhibit a strong substrate preference for MCFA, and so could be used for the future development of vegetable oils with an enriched MCFA content. Of particular interest are thioesterases, acyltransferases and oleosins (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>), which are involved in the processes of releasing fatty acids for assembly, the esterification of fatty acids into glycerolipids and the protection of oils from degradation, respectively. These candidate genes were then confirmed to be functional using the transient <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaf assay system.

The fatty acid composition of the endosperm (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy247-F2">Fig. 2</xref>B</bold>) was similar to the expected profile of 85&#x02013;90% MCFA, determined in previous studies (<xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr">Arkcoll 1988</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B39" ref-type="bibr">Laureles et&#x0fffd;al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B38" ref-type="bibr">Kumar 2011</xref>). The oil content of coconut endosperm was quantified to be 31.41 &#x0fffd; 0.13% (<italic>n</italic> = 3; data not shown), hence verifying that this stage is representative of both active MCFA accumulation and TAG production, with oil content of mature endosperm reaching almost 65% (<xref rid="pcy247-B24" ref-type="bibr">Gunstone et&#x0fffd;al. 2007)</xref>. Following analysis of the coconut endosperm TAG content and composition it was hypothesized that the genes of interest, those involved in the MCFA lipid synthesis pathways, were being highly expressed at this developmental stage as the oil composition reflects active accumulation of MCFAs.

It was also observed in the yeast complementation assay that the positive control (<italic>AtDGAT1</italic>) had a much faster growth rate compared to <italic>CnDGAT1</italic>_V1. The reduced growth rate of <italic>CnDGAT1</italic>_V1 may be attributed to its reduced capacity of utilizing C18:1 for TAG assembly, evident by the lower C18:1 content (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) in <italic>N.benthamiana</italic> leaves compared to <italic>AtDGAT1</italic>. Both of these results could be explained by the differences in substrate specificities, and hence the <italic>Cn</italic>DGAT1v1 may require an increased flux of MCFA in order to perform optimally (<xref rid="pcy247-B54" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et&#x0fffd;al. 2017)</xref>. It would be expected that the <italic>Cn</italic>DGAT1 would exhibit a preference for MCFA based on the high MCFA content of coconut oil (<xref rid="pcy247-B49" ref-type="bibr">Padolina et&#x0fffd;al. 1987</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr">Arkcoll 1988</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B39" ref-type="bibr">Laureles et&#x0fffd;al. 2002</xref>). The fatty acid substrate specificity of <italic>CnDGAT1</italic> was investigated through utilization of the transient <italic>N.benthamiana</italic> infiltration assay. TAG fatty acid compositions were examined following the expression of <italic>CnDGAT1</italic> with and without the co-expression of different class B acyl-ACP thioesterases. In combinations involving <italic>CnFATB3</italic> or <italic>UcFATB</italic> expression, significant increases in TAG content and MCFA incorporation were observed following the addition of <italic>CnDGAT1</italic>. Fatty acid substrate preference of <italic>CnDGAT1</italic> was determined on significant increases in fatty acid composition increase and hence described as C12:0 &#x0003e; C14:0 &#x0003e; C16:0. This fatty acid substrate preference could be validated through the preparation of microsomes from a transformed yeast mutant strain H1246 expressing the <italic>CnDGAT1</italic>, followed by subsequent radiolabeled feeding of DAG and different non-labelled acyl-CoAs. This would allow accurate quantification of fatty acid utilization and hence preference of <italic>CnDGAT1</italic> for TAG production (<xref rid="pcy247-B42" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x0fffd;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x0fffd;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B4" ref-type="bibr">Aznar-Moreno et&#x0fffd;al. 2015</xref>). This system can be used to reveal the biochemistry of TAG assembly in coconut endosperm. Investigating the ability of <italic>CnDGAT1</italic> to efficiently utilize C8:0 or C10:0 acyl-CoAs for TAG assembly may reveal that other DGATs are important in determining the composition of coconut oil.</p><p>With the high abundance of C18:3 in the fatty acid profile of the <italic>N.benthamiana</italic> leaves, it was reasoned that the major metabolic pathway in these leaves for TAG production is the PC-DAG pathway. In this study, the first <italic>PDAT</italic> from coconut palm was identified and investigated for functionality. It was demonstrated that TAG accumulation can be increased by the overexpression of <italic>Cn</italic>PDAT. It was also previously hypothesized that the expression of a substrate-specific PDAT may assist in the recovery of the chlorotic phenotype observed following the build-up of MCFA-containing PC lipids associated with the expression of <italic>FATB</italic>+<italic>CnGPAT9</italic>+<italic>CnLPAAT</italic> (<xref rid="pcy247-B54" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et&#x0fffd;al. 2017)</xref>, through the conversion of these PC lipids into TAG. In previous work that investigated the ability of <italic>Eg</italic>DGAT1 to use C12:0 for assembly (<xref rid="pcy247-B54" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et&#x0fffd;al. 2017)</xref>, it eliminated the accumulation of C12: 0 in phospholipids as TAG assembly occurred by the DAG-derived pathway before it could be converted to PC (<xref rid="pcy247-B43" ref-type="bibr">Lung and Weselake 2006</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B70" ref-type="bibr">Yen et&#x0fffd;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B64" ref-type="bibr">Turchetto-Zolet et&#x0fffd;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B8" ref-type="bibr">Bates et&#x0fffd;al. 2012</xref>). Similarly, the overexpression of <italic>Cn</italic>PDAT was able to recover the chlorotic phenotype previously observed (data not shown). However, in the <italic>PDAT</italic> context of this study, there is still C12:0 in phospholipids as the MCFA-containing PC lipids are being used as a substrate by PDAT for TAG assembly.</p><p>TAGs are present in subcellular spherical lipid droplets of approximately 0.5&#x02013;2 &#x0fffd;m in diameter, surrounded by a matrix of phospholipids and structural proteins, for example oleosin (<xref rid="pcy247-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh and Huang 2004</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B13" ref-type="bibr">Chapman and Ohlrogge 2012</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B46" ref-type="bibr">Murphy 2012)</xref>. In this study, a new <italic>oleosin</italic> gene from coconut palm was identified and functionally confirmed. The visualization of mCherry fluorescence revealed that <italic>Cn</italic>Oleosin expression was localized in the ER and as a surrounding layer of lipid droplets. This result is consistent with the understanding that the oleosin protein is contained within the ER and becomes part of the phospholipid layer surrounding lipid droplets (<xref rid="pcy247-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh and Huang 2004</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B26" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Huang 2017)</xref>. This demonstrates that the expression of <italic>oleosin</italic>, or other lipid droplet associated proteins, will be important for future studies that aim to both increase oil production and stabilize the synthesized oil by providing protection against degradation (<xref rid="pcy247-B12" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et&#x0fffd;al. 2012)</xref>.</p><p>The specificity of acyl-ACP thioesterases play an important role in determining the fatty acid composition of plant oils (<xref rid="pcy247-B56" ref-type="bibr">Salas and Ohlrogge 2002)</xref>. The relative activities of the acyl-ACP thioesterases and acyl-ACP desaturases are responsible for the export of a variety of FAs exported from the plastid, including saturated, mono- and poly-unsaturated FAs (<xref rid="pcy247-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bates et&#x0fffd;al. 2013)</xref>. Here, <italic>FATA</italic>s from coconut palm are first described, showing that <italic>CnFATA</italic> overexpression resulted in a TAG profile predominantly composed of saturated FAs (60%) compared to a more unsaturated TAG profile in the p19+<italic>AtWRI1</italic>+<italic>AtDGAT1</italic> control (40%). This indicates that the increased flow of saturated FAs are efficiently utilized for TAG assembly, assisted by the additional pull capability created by <italic>AtDGAT1</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="pcy247-B66" ref-type="bibr">Vanhercke et&#x0fffd;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B18" ref-type="bibr">El Tahchy et&#x0fffd;al. 2017</xref>). Therefore, the overexpression of thioesterases could be used to enable not only fatty acid profile modifications but to assist in increasing oil yields.</p><p>Currently, crop sources of MCFA-enriched oils are supplied predominantly by the production of coconut palm and oil palm (both palm oil and palm kernel oil which are derived from the mesocarp and endosperm, respectively) (<xref rid="pcy247-B1" ref-type="bibr">Arkcoll 1988)</xref>. With the continued growth in the world population there will be a correlating increased demand for both food and industrial products derived from vegetable oils. Methods of increasing global oil production have previously been proposed including the expansion of agricultural land, and increasing the yields of current oilseed crops through conventional breeding or genetic technology approaches (<xref rid="pcy247-B35" ref-type="bibr">Kinney 1997</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B32" ref-type="bibr">Kempken and Jung 2009</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B10" ref-type="bibr">Baud and Lepiniec 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bates et&#x0fffd;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B67" ref-type="bibr">Vanhercke et&#x0fffd;al. 2014b</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B5" ref-type="bibr">Barcelos et&#x0fffd;al. 2015</xref>). The expansion of land usage for vegetable oil production would be associated with various negative consequences, such as having less available land for the production of other food crops, such as wheat (<xref rid="pcy247-B24" ref-type="bibr">Gunstone et&#x0fffd;al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="pcy247-B45" ref-type="bibr">Murphy 2007)</xref>. With these reasons considered, it provides motives for the transition of MCFA-enriched oils into new crops, whether that may be through traditional oilseed crops or the further development of leaf oil production. In this study, the components needed for the development of a MCFA-enriched oil have been identified, although it remains to be assembled into a complete pathway as previously demonstrated (<xref rid="pcy247-B54" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et&#x0fffd;al. 2017)</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Plant material and harvest</title><p>Coconut (<italic>C.nucifera</italic>) fruits were harvested at approximately 3 months old, from coconut palm trees in Parramatta Park, Cairns, Queensland, Australia.
