All these materials are stored into cortical alveoli, yolk globules or oil droplets during oocyte development. The proper synthesis, storage and displacement of these macromolecular components inside the oocyte play a key role for a successful fertilization process and for the subsequently correct embryo development. In this study, for the first time, the FTIR Imaging (FTIRI) spectroscopy has been applied to characterize the chemical building blocks of several cellular components of swordfish oocytes at different developmental stages. In particular, the spectral features of previtellogenic (PV), vitellogenic (VTG), mature (M) and atretic (A) follicles as well as and of cortical alveoli (CA), yolk vesicles (YV), oil droplets (OD) and Zona Radiata (ZR) have been outlined, providing new insights in terms of composition and topographical distribution of macromolecules of biological interest such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and phosphates. The macromolecular characterization of swordfish oocytes at different developmental stages represents a starting point and a useful tool for the assessment of swordfish egg quality caught in different conditions, such as periods of the year or different fishing area.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Oogenesis</kwd><kwd>Biophysical chemistry</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100005401</institution-id><institution>Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali (Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>note 6775, Art.36 Paragraph 1 Reg (UE9 n 508/2014)</award-id><award-id>note 6775, Art.36 Paragraph 1 Reg (UE9 n 508/2014)</award-id><award-id>note 6775, Art.36 Paragraph 1 Reg (UE9 n 508/2014)</award-id><award-id>note 6775, Art.36 Paragraph 1 Reg (UE9 n 508/2014)</award-id><award-id>note 6775, Art.36 Paragraph 1 Reg (UE9 n 508/2014)</award-id><award-id>note 6775, Art.36 Paragraph 1 Reg (UE9 n 508/2014)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carnevali</surname><given-names>Oliana</given-names></name><name><surname>Candelma</surname><given-names>Michela</given-names></name><name><surname>Sagrati</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><name><surname>Pignalosa</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name><name><surname>Giorgini</surname><given-names>Elisabetta</given-names></name><name><surname>Gioacchini</surname><given-names>Giorgia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In teleost fish, eggs are the final product of oogenesis, a process during which the oocyte growths and differentiates. Eggs need all the necessary information to direct the development of free-swimming larvae as well all the &#x02018;building blocks&#x02019; such as amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates and maternal determinants, to form a viable embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These components are produced by the oocyte it-self or derived from several maternal sources and incorporated into the oocyte during oogenesis. When eggs lack specific compounds, or contain inappropriate amounts of them, they will be not able to sustain the development of a viable embryo. Hence, egg&#x02019;s quality is strictly related to its cytoplasm composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Mediterranean Swordfish (<italic>Xiphias gladius</italic>) is a large, highly migratory and valuable commercial species, which has been recently put through a stock recovery plan by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Despite this, until now, information on its reproduction is scarce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, even if a deep knowledge on its reproductive potential is mandatory for studies on stock assessment and management. In this light, the objective of the present study was to characterize the biochemical composition and structure of swordfish oocytes at different developmental stages. At this purpose, previtellogenic, vitellogenic, mature and atretic follicles retrieved from individuals caught in the central Mediterranean Sea, were analysed for the first time, by Fourier Transform Infrared Imaging (FTIRI) spectroscopy and their macromolecular fingerprint defined.</p><p id="Par4">In particular, the spectral features of oocytes at different developmental stage and of cortical alveoli (CA), yolk vesicles (YV), oil droplets (OD) and Zona Radiata (ZR) have been outlined, providing new insights in terms of composition and topographical distribution of macromolecules of biological interest such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and phosphates.</p><p id="Par5">FTIRI is a well-established technique for the analysis of the macromolecular building blocks of cells and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. By coupling IR spectrometers with bidimensional arrays detectors, it is possible to spectroscopically map specific areas of non-homogeneous biological samples, providing, at the same time and on the same sample, unique biochemical and ultrastructural information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In recent years, several reports exploited FTIRI to characterize the biochemical changes associated with oocyte growth and maturation, in various species including fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

By understanding the molecular and morphological changes that occur in oocytes, it will be possible to identify critical checkpoints in the reproduction of this endangered species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par7">Swordfish (<italic>Xiphias gladius)</italic> is a gonochoristic species and females are multiple pelagic spawners with asynchronous ovaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Its oogenesis is similar to those described for other oviparous species with asynchronous development. Hence, by analyzing the morphological features of ovaries, it is possible to detect at the same time the occurrence of follicles at different maturation stages (oogonia, previtellogenic, vitellogenic, mature/hydrated and atretic follicles). Oocyte development is a complex process which involves several biochemical changes leading oogonia to differentiate into mature oocytes ready to be ovulated and then fertilized. During this process, a primary oocyte grows by several orders of magnitude by synthesizing or taking up specific components that will be stored into cortical alveoli, or yolk globules or oil droplets. These components are involved in fertilization process or in the complete development of a new life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. To date, information on the macromolecular changes of swordfish oocytes at different developmental stage is lacking. At this purpose in the present study, FTIRI spectroscopy has been applied to get new insights into the macromolecular building of swordfish oocytes at different developmental stages, in terms of composition and topographical distribution of macromolecules of biological interest such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and phosphates. A specific focus on cortical alveoli, yolk globules, oil globules and Zona Radiata, has also been outlined. This spectral imaging analysis let map specific areas of non-homogeneous biological samples, generating false color images, that represent the topographical distribution of the total absorption of the infrared radiation. Each pixel corresponds to an IR spectrum. The intensity of the signal associated with a specific IR band provides information both on the amount and the localization within the mapped area of the corresponding molecular/chemical groups.</p><p id="Par8">In fish, oocyte development passes through a first phase of growth (primary growth) followed by a second much more marked one (secondary growth or vitellogenic growth)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Primary growth encompasses the period of oocyte development from oogonia to cortical alveoli stage.</p><p id="Par9">Molecules used at a later stage are directly synthesized from the oocyte itself, and RNA (known as maternal RNA) is accumulated.

By comparing FTIRI results achieved on vitellogenic and atretic oocytes it was possible to obtain an imaging molecular signature that could readily and reliably differentiate vitellogenic oocytes from atretic ones.

A significant higher amount of phosphate groups (PHOSPHO/CELL) was observed only in the Zona Radiata of vitellogenic oocytes (VTG). The presence of lipid-containing compounds within the ZR may be ascribable to the vitellogenin crossing of the numerous canal pore of ZR directly connecting oocytes with surrounding follicular cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Once again, the Zona Radiata of atretic oocytes (ATR) shows a peculiar macromolecular trait, completely different from vitellogenic and mature oocyte and more similar to the previtellogenic one.

The spectral characterization of swordfish oocytes at different developmental stages is a starting point and a useful tool to evaluate changes on egg quality related to different conditions. Further studies are in progress with the aim to evaluate egg composition modifications in females caught in different periods of the year or in different fishing area (within the Mediterranean sea as well as in the Atlantic Ocean) in order to have a clearer picture of reproductive performance of swordfish. These results will be of great importance to support the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in the optimization of the recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish adopted from 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="Par23">10 swordfish (<italic>Xiphias gladius)</italic> females with a Lower Jaw-Fork Length (LJFL) &#x0003e;100&#x02009;cm (according to Italian legislation) were caught by commercial vessels using long lines in the period May&#x02013;July 2017, in the central Mediterranean Sea (Sardinia and Sicily).
