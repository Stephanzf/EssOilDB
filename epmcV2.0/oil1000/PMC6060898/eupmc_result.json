    "Different from cooking oils which contain long-chain fatty acids, virgin coconut oil (VCO) has high medium-chain fatty acids, making it a potential functional food which can provide some health benefits. In this study, our objective is to investigate the physicochemical properties, antioxidant capacity, and metal contents of the VCO extracted through four different processing methods: chilling and centrifugation; fermentation; direct micro expelling-oven dried; and direct micro expelling-sun-dried processes. We found that the physicochemical properties, including moisture content, refractive index, viscosity, iodine value, saponification value, peroxide value, free fatty acid, and fatty acid content, of all the VCO conform to the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community (APCC) standard. All of the VCO predominantly contains lauric acid which is in the range of 48.40%-52.84% of the fatty acid content. The total phenolic content and DPPH radical-scavenging activity (IC 50) of the VCO was obtained to be in the range of 1.16-12.54 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g and 7.49-104.52 mg/ml, respectively, and the metal contents in the VCO were within the acceptable range of the recommended APCC limit. These findings ensure good quality and safety assurance of the VCO produced from the coconut grown in Brunei Darussalam through the different processing methods."
