Resistant starch (RS) is a type of dietary fibre and results in changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. We evaluated the effects of RS supplemented in diets on intestinal microbial composition, bone mineral density, and inflammatory-gene expression in the colon and bone marrow of ovariectomised (OVX) mice. OVX mice were divided randomly into three groups: OVX control, OVX fed a 20% high amylose corn starch (HAS) diet, and OVX fed a 20% acid-hydrolysed HAS (AH-HAS) diet. HAS and AH-HAS diets contained 6.8% and 12% of RS, respectively. After 6 weeks, treatment with HAS or AH-HAS increased the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. in faeces. The AH-HAS diet tended to upregulate mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-10 in the colon, and downregulate expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand and IL-7 receptor genes in the bone marrow of OVX mice. AH-HAS treatment attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss. These findings suggest that AH-HAS might change the microbiota and immune status of the bone marrow, resulting in attenuated bone resorption in OVX mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>resistant starch</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>intestinal microbiota</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-nutrients-11-00297"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that leads to an increased risk of fracture. Menopausal osteoporosis is a disorder involving high turnover of bone and bone loss attributed to oestrogen deficiency in women, and is a serious public-health problem worldwide [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Medical treatments for osteoporosis, such as hormone replacement and bisphosphonates, have undesirable side effects [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, preventive and therapeutic treatments for osteoporosis with fewer undesirable side effects are required.</p><p>Declining levels of oestrogen result in stimulation of bone resorption and, to a lesser extent, bone formation, thereby leading to rapid loss of bone [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This phenomenon has been suggested to be due to loss of the immunosuppressive effects of oestrogen (which results in increased production of the cytokines that promote osteoclastogenesis) and the direct effects of oestrogen on osteoclasts [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Osteoclastic bone resorption is driven by proinflammatory cytokines such as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; produced by immune cells (e.g., activated T cells and B cells) [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In addition, increased permeability allows an expanded range of molecules and potential antigenic load to enter epithelial submucosa, which may initiate abnormal intestinal and systemic proinflammatory responses [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This process is critical in the context of bone homeostasis because osteoclastogenic cytokines are also produced by immune cells present in intestinal subepithelial compartments of the intestine, and any change in intestinal permeability is likely to increase levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines and affect bone density. Li et al., reported that a deficiency of sex steroids increases gut permeability, expands the number of T-helper-17 cells, and upregulates expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, RANKL, and interleukin (IL)-17 in the small intestine and bone marrow [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The intestinal microbiota has a critical role in human health, and dysbiosis can result in inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, or obesity [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This effect is due (at least in part) to the key role of the intestinal microbiota in shaping the immune system [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, some studies have suggested an important role for gut&#x02013;bone signalling pathways and the microbiota in modulating bone health through modification of immune status [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which the gut and the intestinal microbiota modulate bone density are not understood completely.</p><p>Resistant starches (RSs) are a subgroup of dietary fibre that includes all starch and starch-degradation products that are not absorbed and digested in the small intestine of healthy individuals [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Though resistant to digestion in the small intestine, RSs can be used as substrates by bacterial species that reside in the colon, and these fermentations lead to an increase in levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several studies have characterised the capacity of RSs to induce alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, including increases in <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that SCFAs generated from prebiotics regulate the number and function of regulatory T cells in the colon, thereby controlling inflammation [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Previously, we demonstrated that a combination of 9% RS and isoflavones inhibited oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss in ovariectomised (OVX) mice, and that this combination has probiotic effects that increase the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. in the intestinal microbiota of mice [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesised that RS intake would modulate the intestinal microbiota, as well as inflammation in the intestine, resulting in reduced inflammation of bone marrow and bone loss caused by oestrogen deficiency. Here, we evaluated the effect of 12% RS supplemented in a diet on the intestinal microbiota, bone mineral density (BMD), and expression of inflammatory and the genes of tight-junction proteins in the colon and bone marrow of OVX mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-11-00297"><title>2.

Animals and Diet</title><p>Female mice (ddY strain, 8 weeks) were purchased from Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center (Shizuoka, Japan). Mice were housed in individual cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (23 &#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C and relative humidity of 60 &#x000b1; 5%) with a 12-h light&#x02013;dark cycle. Mice were given free access to an AIN-93G diet for 4 days before surgery was undertaken [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The mice were sham-operated (Sham group, <italic>n</italic> = 8) or underwent ovariectomy (OVX) on the same day. OVX mice were divided randomly into three groups (<italic>n</italic> = 8 each): OVX control (OVX), OVX fed a 20% high amylose corn starch (HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + HAS), and OVX fed a 20% acid-hydrolysed high amylose corn starch (AH-HAS)-supplemented diet (OVX + AH-HAS). Mice were pair-fed their respective diets for 42 days with free access to distilled water during this period. AH-HAS contains higher amounts of RS than HAS; the hydrolysed granules have more crystalline regions and, thus, greater resistance to enzymatic digestion [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The concentrations of HAS and AH-HAS were determined in our previous studies; the 20% AH-HAS (12% RS) diet inhibited bone loss slightly in OVX mice [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The experimental diets were prepared according to the AIN-93G formulation (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00297">Table S1</xref>) [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Dry powdered HAS or AH-HAS, as indicated, were added to the diets instead of corn starch. In the supplemented diets, RSs were included as 40.5% and 68.0% of the dry weight for HAS and AH-HAS, respectively (Amylofiber<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>SH and HS-7, respectively; J-OIL MILLs, Tokyo, Japan) [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. When preparing the diets, the RS content of HAS and AH-HAS was 34.4% and 60.0%, respectively (wet weight). HAS and AH-HAS diets contained 6.8% and 12% of RS, respectively. HAS and AH-HAS were kindly provided by J-OIL MILLs.</p><p>After 14 days of treatment, mice (all groups, <italic>n</italic> = 8 each) were euthanised by exsanguination under anaesthesia.

Discussion</title><p>We evaluated the effects of RS supplemented in diets on the intestinal microbial composition, BMD, and expression of inflammation-associated genes in the colon and bone marrow of OVX mice. We found that treatment with HAS or AH-HAS increased the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. in mice faeces. AH-HAS downregulated expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL and inflammation-related IL-7R genes in the bone marrow. AH-HAS treatment attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss. We demonstrated, for the first time, that the alleviative effect of RS feeding on bone loss was associated with inhibition of expression of ovariectomy-induced inflammatory cytokines and osteoclastic mRNA in bone-marrow cells.</p><p>Our results showed that AH-HAS had greater effects than HAS on the weight of caecal content, pH, &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity, changes in the composition/diversity of the microbiota, and gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the colon (<xref rid="nutrients-11-00297-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In healthy individuals, starch entering the large bowel is metabolised actively by the numerous saccharolytic bacteria inhabiting that region of the intestine, thereby resulting in SCFA production and a concomitant reduction in luminal pH [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Acidification of the intracolonic environment is considered important for suppression of the production and activity of a range of bacterial metabolites implicated in colonic disease. Be-ta-glucosidase, an enzyme generated by the intestinal microbiota, contributes to the hydrolysis of glucose monomers from the non-starch polysaccharides. Thus, the increase in &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity might exhibit the change in microbiota composition/diversity.</p><p>The selectively of dietary fibre regulates intestinal bacteria (at least in part) by stimulating the growth of health-promoting bacterial species (<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>) [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Those observations are agreement with the findings of our study: HAS and AH-HAS increased the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). In a previous study, it was reported that mice fed on diets containing 18 and 36% RS were colonized with higher levels of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, and <italic>Allobaculum</italic> species in proportions that were dependent on the concentration of the RS [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. According to Hu et al., an RS diet caused shifts in microbial composition/diversity, including increase in the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp., increased production of SCFAs, and reduced inflammation [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Conversely, in the present study, AH-HAS decreased the abundance of <italic>Clostridium XI</italic> spp., but there were no effects on clusters of <italic>Clostridum IV</italic> or <italic>XIVa</italic>. It has been reported that <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp. can promote increased expression of IL-10 in regulatory T cells [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Whether the decrease/increase in <italic>Clostrida</italic> spp. can cause inflammation is not known, but it has been speculated that they are related to immune homeostasis and inflammation.</p><p>In the colon, we assessed mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and tight-junction proteins. mRNA expression of IL-10 was significantly higher in the AH-HAS group than that in the sham group. IL-10 is an essential component of the immune system within the intestinal tract, where it dampens inflammation and helps to restore tissue homeostasis. Bassaganya-Riera et al. reported that dietary supplementation with RS decreased ileal and colonic inflammatory lesions, and increased IL-10 expression in the splenocytes of wild-type mice [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, tight-junction proteins play crucial parts in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. According to Vaziri et al., consumption of a RS-supplemented diet significantly increased intestinal expression of tight-junction genes, claudin-1 and occludin in rats [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, we did not find significant effects of oestrogen deficiency or diets supplemented with HAS or AH-HAS on expression of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,C) or tight-junction proteins in the colon (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00297">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). Further studies (including on intestinal immune cells) are required to examine the direct effects of RSs on intestinal inflammation and tight junctions.</p><p>In the present study, AH-HAS treatment has been found to attenuate bone loss in the whole and proximal region of the femur significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). There were no statistically significant effects of AH-HAS in BMD of the trabecular and cortical bones, although AH-HAS treatment tended to attenuate trabecular bone loss, and the reduction in BV/TV. The results of femoral BMD analyses were not consistent between those measured by DXA and &#x000b5;CT. Whole femoral BMDs were measured by DXA analysis, whereas BMDs measured by &#x003bc;CT analysis were partial sections of trabecular and cortical bone in the distal femur. Additionally, DXA analysis was performed using the bone mineral content of the measured area, which is a two-dimensional analysis; conversely, &#x003bc;CT analysis is a three-dimensional analysis. Thus, we speculate that differences between these data were caused by variations arising from the analytical sections, as well as differences in the principle of femur measurement.</p><p>Oestrogen deficiency leads to an increase in bone resorption through increased osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity, resulting in the progression of osteoporosis [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our current study indicated that oestrogen deficiency decreased the femoral BMD of OVX mice; HA-HAS attenuated bone loss in the OVX mice. However, there was no effect of HAS or AH-HAS treatment on urinary CTX-I in OVX mice. AH-HAS treatment attenuated OVX-induced bone loss moderately; hence, it might reduce the urinary CTX-I level if the AH-HAS treatment lasts for a longer duration.</p><p>Some researchers have reported that the effect of resistant starch increases calcium and magnesium absorption [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A potential mechanism for this effect is hypothesized to be the caecal wall hypertrophy and caecal acidification that RS-induced fermentation produces in the colon. There are a few reports on the effect of RS on BMD. Zafar et al., reported that diet treated with 5% RS did not increase calcium absorption capacity, and did not affect femoral BMD in male rats, which were fed with the recommended levels of dietary calcium (0.5%) [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although the dietary calcium level used in the study was the same as our study, the diet treated with AH-HAS (12% RS) attenuated the OVX induced bone loss in our study. The effects of AH-HAS on BMD in sham mice were not examined in our study. In future, it is also necessary to examine the effect of AH-HAS on BMD in normal mice.</p><p>We hypothesized that RS intake would modulate the intestinal microbiota, resulting in reduced inflammation of bone marrow and bone loss caused by oestrogen deficiency. Therefore, we assessed the expression levels of cytokines related to inflammation and bone resorption in bone marrow cells. AH-HAS attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B), and inhibited the ovariectomy-induced increases in expression of IL-7R mRNA on day-14 and day-42, and RANKL expression on day-42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,E,F) in bone-marrow cells. The association between inflammation of the bone marrow and bone loss is well established. Studies have shown that bone inflammation is increased in the context of oestrogen deficiency and linked to osteoclastogenesis, and that bone resorption is derived by cytokine-producing activated T cells [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IL-7 regulates homeostasis of T cells and B cells via IL-7R signalling, and IL-7 causes bone resorption through activation of T cells and T cell-dependent augmentation of osteoclastogenesis [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There were no significant effects of AH-HAS on expression of IL7, but IL-7R suppressed the increase in OVX-induced IL-7R expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00297-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,E). In our previous study, soy isoflavones and/or RS inhibited the increase in OVX-induced IL-7R mRNA expression [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, these results suggested that AH-HAS might attenuate the bone loss caused by oestrogen deficiency via regulation of T cells.</p><p>RANKL is an important osteoclast-specific gene and a critical regulator of osteoclast development and bone metabolism [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00297" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. RANKL expression is upregulated by inflammation related-cytokines and hormones. On day-14, we did not observe any significant effects of AH-HAS on expression of RANKL mRNA, although we did observe some effects on IL-7R expression in the bone marrow, as well as significant AH-HAS effects on RANKL expression on day-42. Therefore, these results suggest: (i) ovariectomy-induced expression of pro-inflammatory in bone-marrow cells; (ii) ovariectomy-induced osteoclastic RANKL expression might be downregulated by a diet supplemented with AH-HAS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nutrients-11-00297"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrated that OVX mice fed an AH-HAS-containing diet accelerated fermentation in the caecum, and increased the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. in faeces. The AH-HAS diet tended to upregulate mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the colon, and downregulate expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL and IL-7R genes in the bone marrow of OVX mice. AH-HAS treatment attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss.</p><p>These findings suggest that AH-HAS might change the microbiota and immune status of the bone marrow, resulting in attenuated bone resorption in OVX mice. Taken together, our findings might contribute to the evidence linking the intestinal microbiota, inflammation-related genes in the colon and bone marrow, and bone loss in OVX mice fed an AH-HAS diet.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-nutrients-11-00297"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/2/297/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/2/297/s1</uri>: Figure S1: Gene expression of tight-junction proteins in the colon, Figure S2: Biochemical marker of bone resorption, Table S1: Composition of experimental diets, Table S2: Sequence of primers used for quantitative real-time PCR.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="nutrients-11-00297-s001"><media xlink:href="nutrients-11-00297-s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Y.I., Y.T., I.K., M.I. and Y.N. designed the experiment; Y.T. and Y.M. conducted experiments; Y.T. and Y.M. analysed the data; Y.I., Y.T., I.K., M.I. and Y.N. discussed the data; Y.T. prepared figures and drafted the manuscript; Y.T. and Y.I interpreted the results and revised the manuscript.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>The present study was supported by J-OIL MILLs.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>Y.N., I.K. and M.I. are employees of J-OIL MILLs, the funders of our study, and they had a role in the design of the study and discussed the data.
