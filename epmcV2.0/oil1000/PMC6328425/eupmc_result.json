    "Carum carvi or caraway is traditionally used for treatment of indigestion, pneumonia, and as appetizer, galactagogue, and carminative. Essential oil, fixed oil and many other valuable extractive compounds with industrial applications are prepared from caraway. This review article has new deep research on caraway as medicinal plant. For preparing the manuscript, the information was extracted from accessible international databases (Google scholar, PubMed, Science direct, Springer, and Wiley), electronic resources and traditional books by key word of caraway or Carum carvi. The results of traditional studies exhibited that the galactagogue and carminative effects of caraway fruits are superior to other effects. Although, the traditional scholars used it as appetizer, while caraway was the main ingredient of anti-obesity drugs in traditional medicine, which has been confirmed in two modern clinical trials of human studies. Caraway oil in combination with peppermint oil or menthol is used for treatment of functional dyspepsia in clinical studies. Caraway oil topically on abdomen relieves the IBS symptoms in patient. Although, the use of caraway oil is not recommended in adults under 18Â years due to insufficient data, but it can topically use as anti-colic and carminative agent in children or infants. The anti-aflatoxigenic, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of caraway oil along with its reputation as spice help the industries to use it as natural preservatives and antioxidant agents."
