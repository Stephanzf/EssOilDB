Some fatty acids have been described as modulators of wound healing. However, the role of omega-3 fatty acids is unclear. In the present work, we investigate the effects of oral administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich oil on wound healing in mice. After 4 weeks of EPA-rich oil supplementation (2&#x02009;g/kg of body weight), mice had increased serum concentrations of EPA (20:5&#x003c9;-3) (6-fold) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6&#x003c9;-3) (33%) in relation to control mice. Omega-3 fatty acids were also incorporated into skin in the EPA fed mice. The wound healing process was delayed at the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> days after wounding in mice that received EPA-rich oil when compared to control mice but there was no effect on the total time required for wound closure. Collagen reorganization, that impacts the quality of the wound tissue, was impaired after EPA-rich oil supplementation. These effects were associated with an increase of M2 macrophages (twice in relation to control animals) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations in tissue in the initial stages of wound healing. In the absence of IL-10 (IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice), wound closure and organization of collagen were normalized even when EPA was fed, supporting that the deleterious effects of EPA-rich oil supplementation were due to the excessive production of IL-10. In conclusion, oral administration of EPA-rich oil impairs the quality of wound healing without affecting the wound closure time likely due to an elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Immunology</kwd><kwd>Acute inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation | Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x00026;amp;#x00ED;fico e Tecnol&#x00026;amp;#x00F3;gico (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Funda&#x00026;amp;#x00E7;&#x00026;amp;#x00E3;o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x00026;amp;#x00E3;o Paulo-FAPESP - Grants 2013/06810-4 and 2014/15127-9 Conselho de Aperfei&#x00026;amp;#x00E7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x00026;amp;#x00ED;vel Superior - CAPES - Finance code 001</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Skin is the first line of the body&#x02019;s immunological defense against physical, chemical or biological aggression from the external environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Mammalian skin is divided into epidermis that contains keratinocytes, and dermis composed of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM). In ECM, collagen, laminins, and elastic fibers provide flexibility; whereas glycosaminoglycan, proteoglycans and hyaluroan stabilize growth factors and the three-dimensional space by their high water-binding ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Skin has appendages (hair follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands) and nerves, sensory corpuscles and vasculature. The dermis and skin appendages have important roles in the reepithelialization process because they provide nutritional and mechanical support and supply progenitor cells for the restoration of the epidermis after wounding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

The process is orchestrated by different cell types such as platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts, as well as protein (cytokines, growth factors) and lipid (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes and lipoxins) mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Once a wound is closed, the immature scar can move onto the final remodeling phase. The ECM is important in the maintenance of the structure, function, and signaling of tissues. Then, the ECM molecules reorganize to a cross-linked mode in an attempt to restore skin functionality.
