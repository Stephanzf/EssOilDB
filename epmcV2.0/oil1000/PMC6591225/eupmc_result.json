    "Wound healing is an essential process for organism survival. Some fatty acids have been described as modulators of wound healing. However, the role of omega-3 fatty acids is unclear. In the present work, we investigate the effects of oral administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich oil on wound healing in mice. After 4 weeks of EPA-rich oil supplementation (2 g/kg of body weight), mice had increased serum concentrations of EPA (20:5ω-3) (6-fold) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6ω-3) (33%) in relation to control mice. Omega-3 fatty acids were also incorporated into skin in the EPA fed mice. The wound healing process was delayed at the 3rd and 7th days after wounding in mice that received EPA-rich oil when compared to control mice but there was no effect on the total time required for wound closure. Collagen reorganization, that impacts the quality of the wound tissue, was impaired after EPA-rich oil supplementation. These effects were associated with an increase of M2 macrophages (twice in relation to control animals) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations in tissue in the initial stages of wound healing. In the absence of IL-10 (IL-10-/- mice), wound closure and organization of collagen were normalized even when EPA was fed, supporting that the deleterious effects of EPA-rich oil supplementation were due to the excessive production of IL-10. In conclusion, oral administration of EPA-rich oil impairs the quality of wound healing without affecting the wound closure time likely due to an elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10."
