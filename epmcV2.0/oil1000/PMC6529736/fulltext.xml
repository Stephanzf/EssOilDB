The analysis was performed isocratically on a C<sub>18</sub> analytical column (250 &#x000d7; 4.4 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m) using a Diode Array Detector for the detection of methyl jasmonate at 214 nm. The presence of excipients did not interfere with the quantification of methyl jasmonate. The calibration curve was linear in the concentration range of 25&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;g/mL. The relative standard deviations for intra-day and inter-day precision, and repeatability were less than 2%. The recovery ranged from 88.5% to 90.7% with relative standard deviations not higher than 2%. The limit of detection and quantification were 9.4 &#x003bc;g/mL and 28.5 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively. System suitability parameters were within the accepted range. The proposed method was also robust.

It also triggers unique plant defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses, such as insect-driven wounding, a range of pathogens, and ecological stresses, such as drought, low temperature and salinity [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MeJA has also been proven to induce suppression of cellular proliferation and necrosis, and this expanded its potential application to cancer therapy [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, MeJA has been found to cause aversion in number of ticks such as nymphal <italic>Ixodes ricinis</italic>, <italic>Hyalomma marginatum</italic> rufipes Koch, etc. <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Most interestingly, MeJA has recently been implicated in repelling <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> act as a vector for numerous deadly pathogens including avian malaria parasite, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. These mosquito-vectored viruses are responsible for causing many severe human tropical diseases that incapacitate and seriously debilitate millions of people and unfortunately, decimate countless lives annually <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, absence of vaccines and the lack of effective medical treatments for some of the diseases further alleviate the sufferings and economic consequences among populations <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Overwhelmingly, recent evidences on the involvement of <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes to vector zika virus (which is generally considered an <italic>Aedes-</italic>transmitted pathogen) has raised grave concern [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, these scientific findings advocate urgent strategies to control this mosquito vector. Despite numerous anti-mosquito formulations (of both synthetic and natural origins) are currently available on the market, the menace posed by this mosquito vector remains. It is important to note that applicability of many commercially available anti-mosquito formulations has lessened noticeably, and this can be attributed either to their ineffectiveness, toxic effects or the development of resistance in mosquitoes to these anti-mosquito formulations <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, there is a need to explore new and more efficient preventive measures against the <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes. To the best of our knowledge, insect repellent formulation containing MeJA has not been attempted to date in any form. Hence, there is a vast opportunity in formulation development.</p><p id="p0015">In view of the above, a semi-solid formulation, MeJA-loaded mosquito repellent cream (MeJA-MRC) was developed in our laboratory and its efficacy was investigated against laboratory-reared <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes. Although, MeJA-MRC has exhibited promising activity against <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (data not shown), for practical applicability of MeJA-MRC, a suitable analytical technique is must for the quantification of MeJA adhering to the international standards. Available literatures have presented a number of analytical methods utilizing sophisticated LC-MS-MS <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, LC-ESI-MS/MS <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, SPME-GC-MS <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, RPLC-GC <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, PMME-HPLC <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, SPE-HPLC <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, SPME-HPLC <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and HPLC-UV <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> based techniques for the quantitative analysis of MeJA. Although the effectiveness of these reported methods undoubtedly contribute to efficient separation of MeJA, they have nonetheless several disadvantages, which limit their application. For instances, LC-MS-MS, LC-ESI-MS/MS and SPME-GC-MS may not be available in all laboratories owing to the high capital cost of these equipments. Furthermore, complex instrumentation, extensive sample preparation schemes and requirements for a skilled labor force present major constraints that may impede the application of these highly sophisticated analytical instruments <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Similarly, PMME-HPLC, SPE-HPLC and SPME-HPLC require complex procedure of sample preparation, and involves relatively high consumption of reagents and longer run time <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Whilst a HPLC-UV method is available, this method necessitates the synthesis of fluorescent hydrazones of jasmonic acid by chemical derivatization to render the analyte quantifiable by HPLC. In addition, complex chromatographic conditions and long runs (&#x002c3; 36 min) discourages the application of this method <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, growing concern on the raised transmission of <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus-</italic>vectored diseases, absence of appropriate preventive measures and lack of simple and efficient analytical techniques prompted us to undertake this investigation. Hence, the present investigation focused on to the development of a reproducible, simple, fast and sensitive RP-HPLC method for the quantification of MeJA in MeJA-MRC and validate it conforming to the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Reagents and chemicals</title><p id="p0020">Methyl jasmonate, and HPLC grade solvents such as acetonitrile, methanol and water were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich Chemical, Co., St. Luis, MO, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Instrumentation</title><p id="p0025">All experiments were performed on a fully automatic HPLC system (Agilent Technology, 1260 Infinity, USA), equipped with an online degasser, a quaternary pump, an auto-sampler, a column compartment with oven and a diode array detector (DAD) system.

In this investigation, theoretical and empirical approaches were combined for successful method development and validation. The theoretical approach included the understanding of the physico-chemical characteristics of MeJA that allows the selection of appropriate chromatographic conditions from the available vast literatures. The development of the preliminary method was therefore based on the compilation of comprehensive information of MeJA including molecular mass, solubility, partition coefficient, chemical structure and functionality and UV absorption spectrum. Solubility is an important aspect since it helps to select the suitable mobile phase compositions and column to be used in HPLC method development. MeJA is very slightly soluble in water (340 mg/L at 25 &#x000b0;C) but freely soluble in alcohol. Therefore, ethanol was used for preparing the stock solution of MeJA. Chemically, MeJA (molar mass: 224.3 g/mol; logP: 2.76) is methyl (1R,2R)-3-Oxo-2-(2Z)-2-pentenyl cyclopentaneacetate that contains an ester and a ketone group, and a cyclopentane parent ring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>a). Both the ester and the ketone groups exhibited strong UV absorbance at 214 and 293 nm in acetonitrile: water (75:25 v/v) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>b). Interestingly, each of these two wavelengths was suitable for the quantification of MeJA by HPLC using the DAD detector (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). After obtaining this preliminary information, the method was developed and optimized by altering various HPLC parameters as described in method section.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>(a) Chemical structure of MeJA; and (b) UV absorption spectrum of MeJA.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Fig.&#x000a0;1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><fig id="fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Chromatogram of MeJA obtained at (a) 214 nm; and (b) 293 nm with a DAD detector.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0025">Fig.&#x000a0;2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0065">Taking into account the physico-chemical characteristics of MeJA, both C<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>18</sub> analytical columns were used for the analysis of MeJA. C<sub>18</sub> column displayed better results than the C<sub>8</sub> in terms of optimum plate number (<italic>N</italic>), tailing factor (<italic>T</italic><sub>f</sub>) and resolution (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub>). To finalize the optimum absorbance, the instrument's LOD was obtained for 214 and 293 nm by DAD detector. Ideally, a good method should exhibit minimum LOD while deciding a detection wavelength. In addition, the peak area should be maximum at the selected wavelength <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It is worthy to note that, the minimum LOD was obtained at 214 nm with suitable precision and accuracy. Moreover, the corresponding peak area of MeJA was maximum at this wavelength. Importantly, co-eluting interferences that may likely to appear due the presence of excipients were also absent for this wavelength at the retention time of MeJA (4.5 min). Sensitivity obtained for 293 nm was in-adequate with the proposed analytical method. The selection of the optimum wavelength was further confirmed by peak purity of the resultant peak. At 214 nm, spectra of MeJA exhibited a threshold and similarity curve (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>a), where later was found below the threshold curve. Moreover, all diamonds (each diamond represents the scan path) were found at the green zone. As per the manufacturer instructions, the above conditions persist when a single compound is present in a sample solution (Agilent technologies). Additionally, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>b presented a superimposable peak. It is worth to note that if a single component is present in a peak, the spectra obtained across peak should be superimposable <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus, these findings indicated the presence of only MeJA in the sample solutions. Results obtained in this investigation are not at variance with our previous publication. In that particular contribution, we reported the peak purity while developing a method for the estimation of a mosquito repellent, ethyl anthranilate in a polymeric patch <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, all requisite criteria were met at 214 nm and hence it was selected as an ideal detection wavelength with respect to sensitivity and conditions of the proposed analytical method.<fig id="fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>(a) Peak purity curve of MeJA in MeJA-MRC at 4.5 min; (b) superimposable spectra of MeJA.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0030">Fig.&#x000a0;3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="p0070">MeJA is an oily liquid, and remained as a neutral molecule during the separation. Thus, the mobile phase may be a simple combination of organic solvent and water, and a buffer solution is not required. Two different solvent systems, acetonitrile and methanol were tested for continuous measurement of MeJA (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;1). It was observed that the acetonitrile-water system gave a well-resolved peak and a better resolution than the methanol-water system, providing suitable retention time for MeJA. Further, separation parameters such as retention time, peak area and plates count obtained with the acetonitrile-water system were better than the methanol-water system (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1). In addition, an unknown peak was observed with methanol-water system at 5.8 min that may directly influence the accurate quantitation of MeJA. Results obtained in this experiment are similar to other previous findings. For example, Xia et&#x000a0;al., 2010 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> developed and validated a method for the quantification of linalool using acetonitrile and water as a mobile phase. In their experiments, this mobile phase composition also generated similar well-resolved peaks as obtained in this investigation. Compositions of the mobile phase (60:40, 65:35, 70:30, 75:25, 80:20 and 85:15) have also exerted similar influences on the separation especially peak spacing and resolution. Significant changes in the band spacing with improved peak resolution were evident with the increased concentration of organic solvent i.e. acetonitrile. However, a decrease in the concentration of acetonitrile resulted in increased retention with varied selectivity, band spacing and resolution. Thus, careful selection of both solvent type and composition is essential for successful method development. Finally, acetonitrile and water: (75:25 v/v) was found to be the ideal mobile phase composition for the quantification of MeJA. Similarly, the influence of flow rates (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mL/min) was also found to affect the separation. As the flow rate varied, the retention time of MeJA also varied. The optimum flow rate was found to be 1.0 mL/min. At this flow rate, the <italic>N</italic> was maximum and exhibited the best <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> between all components. However, the quantification of MeJA was performed at ambient temperature, i.e. 25 &#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C owing to its neutral characteristics. Generally, reversed phase chromatographic separation of neutral compounds at higher temperatures results in decrease selectivity <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Given the MeJA's neutral characteristics and to obtain improved separation, temperature was therefore kept constant throughout the experiment. Finally, a C<sub>18</sub> column, a DAD detector, a solvent system comprising of acetonitrile:water (75:25 v/v) with flow rate 1 mL/min and 214 nm detection wavelength was chosen as the most suitable conditions for the proposed analytical method. Symmetric and well defined peak of MeJA with an average retention of 4.5 min was observed with the above conditions. The percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) was less than 2% and column pressure was found well below the defined limit. Ideally, column pressure &#x002c2;150 bar is desirable; and &#x002c2;200 bar is usually essential <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Method validation</title><sec id="sec3.2.1"><label>3.2.1</label><title>Linearity</title><p id="p0075">The linearity of a method is used to determine how well the data fits to the linear equation.

For system linearity, five analyte concentrations were used to obtain a calibration curve. The stock sample solution of MeJA-MRC was diluted with mobile phase to prepare solutions of MeJA containing 25, 50, 100, 200, and 300 &#x003bc;g/mL.

The method is rapid, precise, accurate, sensitive and easy to apply, making it suitable for the quantification of MeJA in MeJA-MRC and any other formulations. The method involves a single step procedure for the preparation of samples and direct injections. Moreover, the run time was also short (4.5 min). Therefore, the proposed analytical method is recommended for the routine analysis of MeJA as such, or in various dosage forms. In addition, the method can be applied in many developing countries or field stations where advanced analytical equipments such as LC/MS or GC/MS are not available. However, it may be necessary to verify the method if other polymers/excipients are used instead of polymers/excipients employed in this study. We speculate a two way outcome when using different polymers. The first one is the interference of polymers, or their monomer units with MeJA. The second one is the poor recovery due to the strong interaction between MeJA and polymers so that MeJA is encapsulated and cannot be extracted with the method used in the present study. This is why a release profile is usually needed when polymers and their rates are determined during encapsulation development.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0165">Johirul Islam: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0170">Pronobesh Chattopadhyay: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data.
