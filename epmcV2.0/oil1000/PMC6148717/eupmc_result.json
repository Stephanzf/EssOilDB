    "In 2015, the Worldatlas recorded 50 countries whose source of income is fossil fuel and its derivatives. Surprisingly, these countries solely depend on this source of energy up to 100% (Omar, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) because of technology improvement. It's so sadden that apart from its adverse effect on the economics of the countries, fossil fuels harmful effects on the universe cannot be overlooked. Meanwhile, the use of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuel and its derivatives are faced by the high oil price, high cost of investment for alternative energy, and unfathomed electricity prices. This research work evaluates desirability of making use of alternative source of energy sources by making use of biomass oil over the use of fossil fuel and its derivatives for electricity generation. Lucky nut is an agricultural non edible seed that was employed as raw material for biofuel production. The non-edible oil was extracted from the seeds and the oil was further converted to Lucky nut biofuel via a heterogeneous based catalyst produced from calcinated pearl spar. For modelling and optimization, design expert coupled with genetic algorithms were used to generate experimental designs so as to correlate the variable factors considered for production. The extraction of Lucky nut seed revealed the optimum production yield of 50.80% (v/v) and the oil is highly unsaturated. Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrophotometer analyses and scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the calcined catalyst obtained from pearl spar showed the major component found in the pearl spar was K with relative abundance of 58.48%, which favoured the yield of Lucky nut biodiesel (91.00% (v/v)). Based on predicted values, the optimum validated Lucky nut biodiesel by RSMED and ANNED were 89.68% (v/v) and 92.87% (v/v), respectively. Produced properties of biofuel conformed to the biofuel standard. The study concluded that Lucky nut seed is a good source of oil, and its transformation to alternative fuel via a using calcined catalyst proved its fitness as a replacement for fossil fuel."
