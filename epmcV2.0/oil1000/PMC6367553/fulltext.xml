The results revealed that 797 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between flower and fruit samples of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic>. Through integrated GO and KEGG function annotations, it was determined that the miRNA target genes were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, plant hormone signal transduction, fruit development, mitosis and regulation of biosynthetic processes. Carbohydrate accumulation genes were differentially regulated by miR156, miR390 and miR395 in the fruit growth and development process. MiR477 is the key miRNA functioning in regulation of genes and involved in fatty acid synthesis.

As an important woody oil plant, edible oil can be obtained (camellia oil) from <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> seeds. Approximately 95% of the global production of camellia oil comes from China, about half of which comes from Hunan Province <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Camellia oil has medicinal and food value <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, and contains a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (including oleic acid, linoleic acid and palmitic acid) and the lowest level of saturated fatty acids. Its fatty acid composition is similar to that of olive oil, thus it is often referred to as &#x0201c;Oriental olive oil&#x0201d; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Xianglin No.210 is an excellent <italic>Camellia</italic> clonal plant widely planted in Hunan Province. It has the characteristics of drought resistance, barren resistance, and high resistance to various pest diseases and high yield performance, as the oil rate of its dry seeds can reach over 35% <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The flowering period is moderate in length, usually from October to late December. The fruit enlargement period is mainly from July to September, but the fully matured fruiting stage will be extended to October. The fat content accumulation generally starts from July until the fruit fully matures <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small (approximately 22 nt), non-coding single strand molecules that negatively regulate gene expressions at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Recent studies have shown that they play a key role in diverse biological processes such as organ development <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, cell proliferation <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, tumorigenesis <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, fat metabolism <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and embryogenesis <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. In plants, functional mature miRNAs are incorporated into Argonaute 1 (AGO1)-containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) target endogenous transcripts for degradation or translational repression in a sequence-specific manner <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. The specific position of the target AGO1 protein is usually between the 10th and 11th nucleotides of the mRNA, which is complementary miRNA <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Studies of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> have shown that some of the genes involved in lipid metabolism <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, drought resistance <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and cold acclimation <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and miRNAs involved in lipid metabolism <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> were defined. Omega-6 fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD<sub>2</sub>) genes can encode microsomal oleate desaturase, which is regarded as a key factor determining the quality of the edible oil <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. In drought stress conditions, 21 unigenes associated with superoxide dismutase (SOD), 52 unigenes related with catalase (CAT) and 100 unigenes associated with peroxidase (POD) were up or down regulated <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. In cold acclimation, many of the genes encoding transmembrane sugar transporters (such as comp214280_c0, comp215715_c0, and comp220377_c0) were differentially expressed in<italic> Camellia oleifera</italic> leaves <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. In natural dried <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> and <italic>C. meiocarpa</italic> seeds, miR5067 was identified as encoding 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase III in fatty acid synthesis, while miR2118 and miR482 regulated long-chain-alcohol oxidase FAO<sub>2</sub> and miR1861 is involved in lysophospholipase for fatty acid catabolism <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>In recent years, molecular methods have been used to study the growth and development, metabolism regulation and resistance of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic>. However, the basic molecular research on <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> is weak and poorly understood, especially for the molecular mechanisms which determine the yield and quality of camellia oil and growth traits of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic>, which certainly hinders the sustainable development of the camellia oil industry. In order to explore the potential role of miRNAs in the synthesis and storage of important nutrients during the development of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit, miRNA expression profiles of flower and fruit samples were investigated using high throughput next generation small RNA sequencing technology.

In total, 1,231 miRNAs, which belong to 42 families, were obtained from sequencing in two libraries (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref>). Among the 42 families, miR156 was the largest represented with 284 members, followed by miR167 and miR160 with 156 and 108 members, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref>).

To further investigate the potential functions of these miRNA target genes, we applied gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses to categorize the miRNA targets. The miRNA target genes were categorized according to biological process, cellular component and molecular function by GO-based enrichment analysis. A total of 358 potential miRNA targets were classified into 143 biological processes, 29 cellular components and 41 molecular functions (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S7</xref>). Some of the significant biological processes with the highest annotation numbers were: cellular response to stimulus (GO:0051716), developmental process (GO:0032502), single-organism developmental process (GO:00447670), signaling (GO:0023052), system development (GO:0048731), response to organic substances (GO:0010033), and developmental processes involved in reproduction (GO:0003006) (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S7</xref>). The common cellular component terms were: macromolecular complex (GO:0032991) and protein complex (GO:0043234) (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S7</xref>). Active transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0022804), lipid binding (GO:0008289), hormone binding (GO:0042562), and mismatched DNA binding (GO:0030983) were among the most abundant classes in the molecular function category (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S7</xref>). GO terms were submitted to enrichment analysis by the agriGO tool <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Among the GO terms related to biological processes, the results showed that several target genes were involved in organism development and signaling pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). In the cellular component category, the target genes were mainly related to chromosomal behavior in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). In molecular function, the majority of the target gene functions were related to transmembrane transporter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C).</p><p>KEGG is a major public database for Pathway Mapping; the most important biochemical metabolic and signal transduction pathways of differentially expressed genes participation were determined by Pathway significant enrichment. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 112 pathways including 109 genes were obtained involving metabolic pathways, plant hormone signal transduction, RNA transport, starch and sucrose metabolism, RNA degradation, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, lipid metabolism and fructose and mannose metabolism (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref>). The top 20 statistics of pathway enrichment for fruit-VS-flower are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. The plant hormone signal transduction pathway was represented by 4 genes and contained auxin-, cytokinine- and gibberellin- inducible via flower developed to fruit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). For example, tryptophan metabolism was involved in the pathway, contributes to auxin synthesis, enriched transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) and auxin response factor (ARF). These genes were regulated by the miR393 and miR160 families, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Arabidopsis histidine kinase 2/3/4 (CRE1) was enriched to zeatin biosynthesis associated with cytokine synthesis, and the gene was targeted by ath-miR858a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). Similarly, DELLA protein (DELLA) was enriched to gibberellin biosynthesis associated with cysteine and methionine metabolism, and the gene was targeted by gma-miR171k-5p and osa-miR171c-5p. The photosynthesis pathway was represented by 1 gene and involved in photosynthetic electron transport inducible via flower developed to fruit, and contained ferredoxin (PetF) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of differentially expressed miRNAs by qRT-PCR</title><p>To validate the data obtained from the high-throughput sequencing, we randomly selected six miRNAs (ahy-miR156a, ath-miR858a, stu-miR384-5p, lus-miR394a, ath-miR168a-5p, hbr-miR156) and their corresponding target genes (CL7673.Contig1_All, Unigene31238_All, CL2703.Contig3_All, CL2703.Contig1_All, Unigene62526_All, CL15005.Contig2_All). For this purpose, we determined the expression levels between<italic> Camellia oleifera</italic> flower and fruit using log2 fold change (2<sup>-&#x02206;&#x02206;Ct</sup>) values with three technical and three biological replicates. The expression results showed that miRNAs were both up-regulated (ahy-miR156a, ath-miR858a, stu-miR384-5p, lus-miR394a) and down-regulated (ath-miR168a-5p, hbr-miR156) in the qRT-PCR analysis, which were similar to the deep sequencing data results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A).

The fruit is the main source of the economic benefits of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic>, and how to achieve high yield, quality and efficiency of the species and its fruit has become an important research area <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. The fruit is a plant reproductive organ that develops from the ovary or other parts of the flower (such as receptacle, calyx, etc.) by pistils after pollination fertilization <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. The growth and development of fruit include the whole process from fertilization to fruit growth, maturation and senescence, and it is also the process of continuously accumulating and transforming nutrients and fruit morphogenesis construction <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. During the fruit growth and development process, the accumulation of nutrients mainly includes carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, most of which are transported by other organs of the plant, such as roots and leaves, while carbohydrate metabolism is the basis of regulation in its process <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. During the early stages of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit development, carbohydrates come from the photosynthesis of leaves and fruits <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we observed differentially expressed miRNA in the fruit and flower of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> by using high-throughput RNA sequencing. We found 42 families of known miRNAs and 23 families of novel miRNAs, respectively. Among the 65 families, the most highly expressing miRNAs were miR168, miR166, miR396, miR157, miR156, miR390 and so on, which were similar to the high expression miRNA of flowers and fruits in <italic>Camelina sativa</italic><xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. The results of comparing the differentially expressed miRNAs showed that 751 miRNAs were overlapped between fruit and flower miRNAs, such as miR168, miR160, miR396, miR164, miR156, miR393, miR858, and those were similar to the overlaps of <italic>Camelina sativa</italic>
<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>.</p><p>Chloroplasts are important sites for plant photosynthesis, which converts light energy into chemical energy (through electron transfer reactions), and supplies NADPH and ATP for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation into carbohydrates and for the synthesis of several essential compounds of plant growth <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>-<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. In photosynthetic electron transfer reactions, electrons are generated by splitting water by light energy, and are transferred via photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome (Cyt) b<sub>6</sub>f complex and photosystem I (PSI) to ferredoxin (Fd). Fd is the first soluble electron acceptor of the electron transport chain, and determines the efficiency of the electron transfer between the thylakoid membrane and the soluble enzymes dependent on these electrons <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. In this study, we found that miR156 targets Fd (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>) were expressed up-regulated in fruit, and the photosynthesis in fruit can be improved by increasing the efficiency of the electron transfer, which is similar to the results of reducing levels of miR156 promoting the rate of photosynthesis in plant leaves<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>-<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. Ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> oxidoreductase (FNR) is the key enzyme linking the light reactions of photosynthesis to carbon assimilation, which functions in the last step of the linear electron transfer (LET), mediating electron flow from reduced Fd to NADPH for fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Calvin cycle<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>.</p><p>Studies have shown that miR156 and miR390 have the same developmental process oppositely regulating developmental timing in plants <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>. In the development of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit, miR390 targets FNR expression up-regulation in fruit which is conducive to the generation of NADPH (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>), and it is possibly related to the miR156 and miR390 regulated tasiRNA network. NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) is a key enzyme controlling the "malate valve", which converts oxaloacetate to malate using NADPH from photosynthetic electron transport, facilitating the regeneration of the electron acceptor NADP<sup>+</sup> in the chloroplasts, thus being indirectly involved in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>-<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. Compared with flower, miR395 targets NADP-MDH were expressed up-regulation (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>) in fruit and consistent with the expression of Fd and FNR, and also similar to the over-expression of NADP-MDH resulting in an increased synthesis of tobacco biomass <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>. These results suggest that the concurrently low-level expressions of miR156, miR390 and miR395 in <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit may be the main reason for the accumulation of carbohydrates in the fruit growth and development process.</p><p>As an important oil crop, oil is one of the most important accumulated nutrients in the growth and development process of the fruit of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic>. The main component of vegetable oil is triacylglycerol (TAG), which results from glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and fatty acid CoA condensation <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>. The glycolytic metabolic pathway is the upstream metabolic pathway of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit oil synthesis; the intermediate product dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) of the glycolytic pathway is reduced to G3P by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) catalyst <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts pyruvate, which is the final product of glycolysis, into acetyl-CoA, then acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) to malonyl-CoA which is the substrate for biological fatty acid synthesis <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>. &#x003b2;-D-fructose-6-phosphate is one of the important intermediates in glycolysis and it has a very wide range of sources. One major source of it is the conversion of L-sorbose-1-phosphate to D-sorbitol-6-phosphate by the reversible catalysis of sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase, then the reverse catalysis of the sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase to &#x003b2;-D-fructose-6-phosphate. In this study, we found that miR156 target butanol dehydrogenase was up-regulated (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>), which may be involved in increasing the &#x003b2;-D-fructose-6-phosphate to promote glycolysis. In nature, acetyl-CoA carboxylase has two functional forms and each contains the four different components required for activity: biotin carboxylase, biotin carboxyl carrier protein, &#x003b1;- carboxyl transferases and &#x003b2;-carboxyl transferases. One form is heteromeric, in which the all four enzymatic components as individual subunits are combined into a multienzyme complex. The other form is homomeric, whereby all four enzymatic components are concatenated into a single polypeptide, and is the predominant form for <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>. In fruit, miR477 induced the target acetyl-CoA carboxylase carboxyl transferase subunit alpha up-regulated (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>), and it may be related to increasing the efficiency of fatty acid synthesis. There are two major biochemical pathways of linoleic acid (LA) to oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs) in LA metabolism; they begin with formation of the conjugated hydroperoxydienes 9- hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HPODE) and 13- hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE), which are then rapidly reduced by glutathione-dependent peroxidase to the alcohols 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9-HODE) and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), respectively. Finally, the 9-HODE and 13-HODE can be converted to the ketones 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (9-oxoODE) and 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (13-oxoODE) via hydroxy-fatty acid dehydrogenase, respectively. MiR156 targets butanol dehydrogenase up-regulated expression (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>) which will be beneficial to the 13-HODE transformed to 13-oxoODE, which may be related to the relative content of LA being decreased in <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit during the ripening process <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>.</p><p>These results illustrate that the down-regulation of miR156 and miR477 contributed to the fat accumulation and nutrients transformation in <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit during ripening, and previous studies have shown that the down-regulation of miR156 expression plays an important role in the synthesis of fatty acids <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>.
