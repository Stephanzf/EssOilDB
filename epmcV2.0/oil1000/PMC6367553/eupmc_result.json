    "To obtain insight into the function of miRNAs in the synthesis and storage of important nutrients during the development of Camellia oleifera fruit, Illumina sequencing of flower and fruit small-RNA was conducted. The results revealed that 797 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between flower and fruit samples of Camellia oleifera. Through integrated GO and KEGG function annotations, it was determined that the miRNA target genes were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, plant hormone signal transduction, fruit development, mitosis and regulation of biosynthetic processes. Carbohydrate accumulation genes were differentially regulated by miR156, miR390 and miR395 in the fruit growth and development process. MiR477 is the key miRNA functioning in regulation of genes and involved in fatty acid synthesis. Additionally, miR156 also has the function of regulating glycolysis and nutrient transformation genes."
