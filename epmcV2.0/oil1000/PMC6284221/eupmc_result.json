    "The aim of this study was to determine the impact of thyme essential oil supplementation in rabbit rations on performance, carcass criteria, and meat quality under hot environmental conditions. A total of 75, 4-week-old Californian male rabbits were assigned to 5 dietary treatments until 12 weeks of age. The rabbits were reared in an open house system (38 °C average ambient temperature and 26% to 35% relative humidity). Treatments were as follows: unsupplemented standard ration, negative control (CON); standard ration supplemented with 1.50 g/kg olive oil as carrier, positive control (POS); POS + 50 mg/kg thyme oil (TO1); POS + 100 mg/kg thyme oil (TO2); and POS + 150 mg/kg thyme oil (TO3). Dietary thyme oil up to 150 mg/kg improved (P < 0.001) feed intake and growth performance in comparison to CON. The highest average daily gain and most efficient feed conversion ratio (linear, P < 0.001 and quadratic, P < 0.001) were found for TO1 followed by TO2, TO3 and POS, respectively. The incorporation of thyme oil improved (P < 0.001) carcass criteria and decreased (P < 0.001) perirenal and scapular fat without any side effects on internal organs. Notably, the water holding capacity of rabbit meat was greater (P < 0.001), and the lipid oxidation was lower (P < 0.01) in rabbits fed treated rations compared with CON. Differences were also recorded in oxymyoglobin and metmyoglobin contents in rabbit meat among treatments. In conclusion, thyme oil of a specified composition and to be added to a rabbit ration up to 100 mg/kg using 1.50 g/kg olive oil as a carrier can be used as an efficient feed additive for improving productive performance of rabbits under hot environmental conditions."
