A range of water-in-oil emulsions with different water contents and droplet size distributions were analysed using a microwave cavity perturbation technique together with dynamic light scattering.

The presence of gas bubbles and suspended solids also considerably restrict their applicability to such emulsion systems.<xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Much effort has been made recently to explore alternative methods for determining the droplet size of emulsions, including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR),<xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Raman spectroscopy<xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and confocal laser scanning microscope.<xref rid="cit14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, the measurement error of above techniques is challenged especially at low water content. Therefore, it is of considerable scientific and also industrial significance to develop an easy, rapid and more accurate way to assess the dispersity of emulsions.</p><p>An alternative rapid and non-invasive method to characterise the dispersity of emulsions is reported here based on the interrelationship between the droplet size distribution and the characteristic dielectric properties of emulsions. An effective mixing model is proposed to correlate the dielectric constant of the emulsion system with the emulsion dispersity. For this, we have investigated the dielectric properties of emulsified oil having different water contents and droplet size distributions using a microwave cavity perturbation technique. The applicability of this technique for heavy oil emulsions is also demonstrated.</p></sec><sec><title>Theoretical considerations</title><p>The dielectric properties of emulsions cannot be simply derived from the properties of the individual pure components due to the existence of interfacial polarization and local field corrections.<xref rid="cit15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Several theories, such as those of Maxwell,<xref rid="cit16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Wagner,<xref rid="cit17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Hanai<xref rid="cit15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Lichtenecker,<xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> have been reported in the last century to estimate the dielectric properties of mixtures and thereafter used to predict or rationalise the dielectric properties of emulsions.<xref rid="cit19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, these models are all based on the assumption that the dispersed phase is considered as assembly identical spheres in the continuous phase. In fact, a size distribution of dispersed droplets will always exist in a real emulsion system, and previous studies demonstrated that the size distribution of micelles influences the permittivity of the mixture.<xref rid="cit21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Therefore, it is essential to take carefully into account the dispersity of emulsion in any mixing model for dielectric properties.</p><p>A monodispersed water-in-oil emulsion system, in which all the water droplets are assumed to be identical spheres, is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>.

The microwave cavity perturbation measurement system was fabricated in Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at University of Oxford. The cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>) is made of aluminium and in a cylindrical shape. The cavity excitation is provided by two open-circuit SMA connectors coupled into the electric field at a frequency of 2.5 GHz. The TM<sub>010</sub> mode is employed to establish a highly uniform E-field near the axis, resulting in a minimal depolarization of the sample in the measurement.<xref rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The electric field distribution in this cavity simulated by COMSOL Multiphysics is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>. In the measurement, the sample was loaded into a quartz tube and placed in the centre of the cavity, since the inner tube radius (2 mm) is far smaller than the radius of cavity, the E-field applied to the sample can be regarded highly uniform.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>The microwave cavity perturbation measurement system.

The attractive features of this approach are as follows: (1) it is a rapid measurement which takes only milliseconds, thus allowing this application to real time analysis and control; (2) instead of focusing on a single point, the microwaves penetrate the entire sample based on the sample holder dimension. Therefore, a reliable volumetric analysis of emulsions can be determined; (3) the microwave power level in the measurements is 0 dBm (<italic>i.e.</italic> 1 mW per rms), so there is negligible sample heating. We note that this technique is non-invasive and non-destructive, thereby providing a potential means of a rapid <italic>in situ</italic> industrial analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Deviation from values predicted by theoretical models</title><p>Initially we measured the dielectric properties of emulsions with different water contents (0&#x02013;20.0 vol%) and compared the data with the values predicted by the mixing models. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, the dielectric constant of water-in-oil emulsions increases rapidly with the water content, because the dielectric constant of water is much higher than the value of oil phase. The sensitivity to the water content offers potential applications of this technique for multiphase flow meters.<xref rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> MATLAB R2017a was employed to calculate the dielectric constant of emulsions from the mixing models. The results show that for a certain water content, the values predicted by Lichtenecker model are higher than the values calculated from serial capacitor model. The deviation between the measured dielectric constant and the two limiting predicted values arises from the polydispersity of the water phase, thus we can directly investigate the dispersity of emulsions through the variation of measured dielectric constant.</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Dielectric constant of emulsions with different water contents.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>, the measured dielectric constant is near the value predicted by serial capacitor model at emulsifying time of 1 min, suggesting that the emulsion system is non-uniform.

The multiple peaks at 1 min indicate a broad size distribution of water droplets. With an increase in the emulsifying time, the distribution peaks have a negative shift and a narrower bandwidth, demonstrating the emulsion system is more uniform.

The energy density for emulsification increases with rotation speed, thus resulting in a smaller average droplet size.

A higher dispersity factor indicates a narrower droplet distribution and hence a more uniform emulsion. Importantly, the microwave cavity analysis is critically sensitive to the variation of droplet size distribution even at low water content due to the significant difference between the dielectric constant of water and oil. Although these measurements have been conducted at the ISM frequency of 2.45 GHz, it will also be possible to perform similar measurements on inhomogeneous mixtures of greater volume by increasing (proportionately) the size of the cavity, thus reducing the resonant frequency of the TM<sub>010</sub> mode. One such frequency within an ISM band is around 900 MHz, for which the host cavity will have an internal diameter of around 25.5 cm. We have found in other work that it is possible to have a sample tube with an internal diameter of up to 5 cm, with a pair of axial chokes, thus maintaining a very high <italic>Q</italic> factor. For such a 900 MHz cylindrical cavity of aspect ratio diameter to height of 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1, this yields an active sample volume of up to 0.5 litres.</p></sec><sec><title>Employed for emulsified heavy oil characterization</title><p>We also conducted the microwave cavity analysis on heavy fossil oil emulsions.

The systems investigated have ranged from model emulsions to fossil fuel emulsions, illustrating the great potential of this technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Emulsion preparation</title><p>The emulsions were prepared utilizing a high shear homogenizer with a maximum rotation speed of 24&#x02009;000 rpm. A composite nonionic emulsifier was first dissolved in the oil phase, then a certain amount of deionized water was added, and shearing was performed at a fixed rotation speed. The emulsifier was a composite of Span 85 and Tween 85. In this study HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance) = 4 gave stable water-in-oil emulsions. The volume fraction of emulsifier was 5 vol% in emulsion preparation. Dodecane (&#x02265;99%) and hexadecane (&#x02265;99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. Light crude oil was provided by Saudi Aramco, and coal tar was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The physical properties of the crude oil sample are shown in the ESI Table 2.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>
</p></sec><sec><title>Emulsion characterization</title><p>Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was also performed immediately after the emulsion preparation to measure the droplet size distribution using a Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments). We performed each test for three times and irreversible sedimentation was not detected in such short period of measurement. A detection angle of 173&#x000b0; was used and 10 runs were carried out in each measurement. A GXML3030 Trinocular Reflected and Transmitted Light Microscope (GT Vision) was used to observe the emulsified crude oil in this work.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts to declare.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><alt-text>Supplementary information</alt-text><media xlink:href="SC-009-C8SC00406D-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful for financial support from KACST, Saudi Arabia and EPSRC (EP/N009924/1).
