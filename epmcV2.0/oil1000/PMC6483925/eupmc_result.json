    "Feline embryo development was examined for 7 days after fertilization using commercially available human media supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cumulus-oocyte complexes were categorized as Grades 1, 2, and 3 according to morphology. Only-One Medium (OM) was used for in vitro culture (IVC) in OM + BSA, OM + FBS, and OM + BSA/FBS, with BSA supplementation for the first 2 days and FBS for the subsequent 5 days. Embryos cultured in Early Culture Medium (1-2 days) and Blastocyst Medium (3-7 days) were defined as EB + BSA and EB + BSA/FBS. The developmental rate until the blastocyst stage of Grade 1 and 2 oocytes cultured in OM + BSA/FBS was higher than for the other groups and was significantly higher than for the OM + BSA and EB + BSA groups (P<0.01). Grade 3 oocytes cultured in OM + BSA/FBS also showed the greatest proportion of blastocyst formation. However, FBS supplementation throughout the IVC period reduced blastocyst number. The percentage of 2 pronuclei after fertilization as well as blastocyst cell number were significantly higher in Grade 1 and 2 than Grade 3 oocytes when cultured in OM + BSA/FBS (P<0.05). These results indicate that commercially available OM supplemented with BSA for the first 2 days of culture and FBS for the subsequent 5 days is suitable for feline embryo development until the blastocyst stage."
