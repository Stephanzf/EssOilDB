available human media supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Cumulus-oocyte complexes were categorized as Grades 1, 2, and 3 according to
morphology. Only-One Medium (OM) was used for <italic>in vitro</italic> culture (IVC) in
OM + BSA, OM + FBS, and OM + BSA/FBS, with BSA supplementation for the first 2 days and
FBS for the subsequent 5 days. Embryos cultured in Early Culture Medium (1&#x02013;2 days) and
Blastocyst Medium (3&#x02013;7 days) were defined as EB + BSA and EB + BSA/FBS. The developmental
rate until the blastocyst stage of Grade 1 and 2 oocytes cultured in OM + BSA/FBS was
higher than for the other groups and was significantly higher than for the OM + BSA and EB
+ BSA groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Grade 3 oocytes cultured in OM + BSA/FBS also
showed the greatest proportion of blastocyst formation. However, FBS supplementation
throughout the IVC period reduced blastocyst number. The percentage of 2 pronuclei after
fertilization as well as blastocyst cell number were significantly higher in Grade 1 and 2
than Grade 3 oocytes when cultured in OM + BSA/FBS (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). These
results indicate that commercially available OM supplemented with BSA for the first 2 days
of culture and FBS for the subsequent 5 days is suitable for feline embryo development
until the blastocyst stage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>feline</kwd><kwd>fetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>human medium</kwd><kwd><italic>in vitro</italic> culture</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>In vitro</italic> reproductive technologies in the domestic cat (<italic>Felis

&#x0201c;morula block&#x0201d; [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], several studies have been

two-step culture was used and the culture medium was changed on day 2 or 3 than when a
one-step culture was used [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Specifically, the addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS) instead of
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the late period of culture was a key factor for the improved
results.</p><p>In many species, ion concentrations and amino acid composition in the culture medium are
important for embryo development [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Many types of synthetic media have been developed
especially for human embryos and are commercially available [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Predefined, commercially available
media are preferable as they are made under adequate quality control conditions and
standardize embryo cultures among different laboratories. If these media could be used for
feline embryo culture, they could contribute to the conservation of endangered feline species
by <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo production. However, Herrick <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] suggested that feline embryos maintain ionic
homeostasis differently from rodent embryos. Therefore, the availability of commercially
available media for IVC of feline embryos should be investigated. Recently, commercially
available serum-free media have been developed for human embryo IVC, with two opposing views
emerging on the ideal composition. These are the &#x0201c;single-step media&#x0201d;, which contain all
components embryos need for development; and the &#x0201c;sequential media&#x0201d;, having a different
composition that aims to fulfill the needs of the embryo during early or late development
[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we examined the period of FBS supplementation using alternative human
IVC media of different compositions to identify the appropriate conditions for IVC of
fertilized feline oocytes until blastocyst formation.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Cat ovaries and testes with epididymis were collected from a local veterinary clinic

cultures, the oocytes were incubated using Only-One Medium (Nippon Medical &#x00026; Chemical
Instruments Co., Ltd.) supplemented with BSA (0.3%). During the OM + BSA culture, half of
the medium was replaced with identical fresh medium on days 2, 4, and 6 of IVC. In the OM

(Nippon Medical &#x00026; Chemical Instruments) with BSA in the early culture, followed by
Blastocyst Medium (Nippon Medical &#x00026; Chemical Instruments) with BSA in the late
culture. Similarly, in the EB + BSA/FBS group, Early Culture Medium with BSA and
Blastocyst Medium with FBS were used in the early and late cultures, respectively. In the
late culture, half of the medium was renewed on days 4 and 6.</p><p>We then performed the following three experiments using presumptive zygotes. In
experiment I, presumptive zygotes were cultured in various single and sequential IVC media
(<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In experiment II, zygotes were
selected for culture in OM + BSA/FBS and OM + FBS (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to investigate the effect of FBS in the early or whole period of IVC.
Finally, we performed experiment III for assessment of parthenogenesis, fertilization
rate, and blastocyst cell number in OM + BSA/FBS culture using Grade 1, 2, and 3
oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of oocyte parthenogenesis</title><p>In experiment III, we performed the IVM, IVF, and IVC in OM + BSA/FBS as described above
in experiments I and II, except that sperm was used in the IVF step. After 7 days of IVC,
we examined oocyte parthenogenetic development.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of fertilization rate</title><p>After 18 hr of IVF, oocytes were fixed and stained for assessment of the fertilization
status. Briefly, the oocytes without cumulous cells were washed twice in Dulbecco&#x02019;s

with 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100
(Merck) at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then placed in DPBS containing 0.3%
(w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed
oocytes were transferred in small drops consisting of DPBS supplemented with 90% (v/v)
glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) and 10 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> bisbenzimide
(Hoechst 33342; Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) for 5 min, mounted on a slide, overlaid with a

classified into different groups according to Nagano <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with some modifications, such as: non-penetrate,
when sperm could not penetrate the oocyte; 2PN, the presence of 2 pronuclei (male and
female) was considered as normal fertilization; polyspermy, when three or four pronuclei
were present; others, an enlarged sperm head with an anaphase II/telophase II chromosome
or a male pronucleus and telophase chromosome; parthenogenesis, development of over 2 cell
stage; and degenerated, oocytes where the pronuclei were unidentifiable or invisible.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of blastocyst cell number</title><p>In experiment III, all blastocysts were rinsed twice with DPBS, and then fixed and

medium supplemented with FBS instead of BSA, in the late period of the culture, as
reported by Pope <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As
shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the percentage of morula +
blastocyst stage embryos among Grade 1 and 2 oocytes was not significantly different among
the four IVC groups designated in this study. However, the OM + BSA/FBS group showed the

the groups could develop to the blastocyst stage. Notably, as shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the OM + BSA/FBS group showed the highest proportion of
blastocyst formation and the proportion was significantly higher than for the OM + BSA

Therefore, it was essential to examine morula and blastocyst formation in the IVC
supplemented with FBS for the entire period. As shown in <xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, there was no difference in morula + blastocyst formation between the OM +
BSA/FBS and the OM + FBS groups among any of the oocyte Grades. However, a significant
reduction in blastocyst formation was observed in the OM + FBS group compared to the OM +
BSA/FBS group in the IVC with oocytes of all Grades (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment III</title><p>We evaluated the parthenogenesis rates of Grade 1 and 2 and Grade 3 oocytes in OM +
BSA/FBS. The proportions of parthenotes in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes and in Grade 3 oocytes
were 3.3 and 7.9%, respectively. Only one oocyte in both Grade 1 and 2 oocytes and Grade 3
oocytes developed to the 8-cell stage; no oocyte developed to the morula or blastocyst
stage.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the fertilization rate of Grade 1 and 2 and Grade 3 oocytes. As shown
in <xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the percentage of 2PN formation was significantly higher in Grade 1 and 2
than in Grade 3 oocytes (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), whereas there was no difference in

higher in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes than in Grade 3 oocytes (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).
There was a trend (<italic>P</italic>=0.069) toward blastocyst formation in Grade 1 and 2
oocytes compared to Grade 3 oocytes. The blastocyst cell number was also significantly
higher in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes than in Grade 3 oocytes (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To find a suitable condition to improve the development of feline embryos using a
commercially available human IVC medium, we examined the effects of the period of FBS
supplementation using alternative human IVC media. As reported by Pope <italic>et
al</italic>. [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the addition of FBS in the late
period of IVC led to the formation of more blastocysts. Culture in OM + BSA/FBS, in
particular, resulted in a significantly higher number of blastocysts than culture in OM +
BSA, whereas no difference in the number of morulae + blastocysts was observed between these
cultures. These results indicate that FBS contains components that can overcome the morula
block in the late IVC period. Mun <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that the addition of FBS in the late IVC period of porcine embryos
significantly increased blastocyst formation. They also found that FBS significantly reduced
the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reduction of ROS prevents
parthenogenetic activation and increases developmental competence parameters, such as
blastocyst formation. In addition, Singh and Armstrong [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that FBS contains insulin-like growth factor (IGF) which is essential
for embryo growth. Indeed, supplementing IVC with IGF inhibited apoptosis and increased the
blastocyst formation rate in rabbits [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], bovines
[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and humans [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, Herrick <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported the extent to which unidentified components of FBS can promote optimal
blastocyst development.</p><p>However, supplementation with FBS during the entire IVC period (the OM + FBS group)
partially inhibited blastocyst formation. These results suggest that late period-specific
enhancing factors act reversely in early embryo development. Mun <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] also reported that reduction of intracellular
ROS in the early period of IVC negatively affected developmental parameters.</p><p>The OM + BSA/FBS group showed the highest rate of blastocyst formation in the present
study, and the rate of blastocyst formation in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes was 20.9%. Herrick
<italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] defined the
physiological requirements of domestic cat embryos and attempted to develop and optimize
feline-specific culture media. However, they used <italic>in vivo</italic>-matured oocytes
whereas ours were matured <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, their optimized media cannot
be compared to OM + BSA/FBS. In contrast, Naoi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] used <italic>in vitro</italic>-matured Grade 1 and 2
oocytes from ovaries of ovariohysterectomized cats and showed that the proportion of
blastocysts was 6.7%. In the study, the oocytes were incubated in modified Earle&#x02019;s balanced
salt solution (MK-1) with BSA during early culture and subsequently in the same medium but
with added FBS (5%) during late culture. These results suggest that the commercial human
single-step media used in the present study are highly beneficial for IVC of cat embryos.
Moreover, the results obtained using Grade 3 oocytes indicate that the present culture
condition can promote the development of poor-grade feline oocytes <italic>in
vitro</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, using OM + BSA/FBS, the morulae + blastocyst and blastocyst rates in
Grade 3 oocytes were reduced in experiments II and III compared to experiment I, whereas
those of Grade 1 and 2 oocytes were not. Naoi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] indicated that the reproduction cycle stage of donor cat ovaries has
no apparent effects on the <italic>in vitro</italic> development of Grade 1 oocytes after
IVF, whereas for poor grade oocytes the rate of blastocyst formation was different in the
estrous cycle. Since the estrous stage of the queens was not considered in this study, the
differences in the results for Grade 3 oocytes among the experiments may have been due to
the use of oocytes at different stages of the estrous cycle. Moreover, another group [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] has suggested that the size of the follicles/oocytes,
as well as their qualities, may affect the <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation and
subsequent development of cat oocytes. Therefore, future studies should evaluate the effects
of the stage of the estrous cycle, as well as oocyte diameter, on the development of Grade 3
oocytes.</p><p>In a study of human oocytes using serum-free media, the single-step culture showed improved
[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or
comparable [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] results in blastocyst formation
compared to the sequential culture. In the present study, the blastocyst formation rate of
the OM + BSA group was similar to that of the EB + BSA group. This result may have been due
to the medium exchange. Fujita <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported that, during culture, embryo-secreted growth factors are essential for
embryo development. Ammonia and ROS are generated as byproducts of cellular metabolism and,
although a certain level of ROS is beneficial for embryo development, higher levels of ROS
and ammonia are not suitable for embryo development <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In
addition, during culture, it is important to remove some of the old medium and replace it
with fresh medium, as fresh medium contains almost all the important ingredients for embryo
culture and old medium contains embryo-secreted growth factors. Therefore, we replaced half
the old medium with fresh medium for better embryo development. However, the increased
stability of alanyl-L-glutamine results in significantly reduced ammonium production with
incubation at 37&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Only-One Medium contains
alanyl-L-glutamine instead of L-glutamine and therefore the medium does not have to be
changed when it is used for human embryo culture. In contrast, Blastocyst Medium contains
L-glutamine. As embryos are stressed by medium exchange, embryo development using the
Only-One medium may have been better if the medium had not been changed.</p><p>The OM + BSA/FBS group exhibited relatively, but not significantly, increased blastocyst
formation compared to the EB + BSA/FBS group. As Biggers and Racowsky [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that fertilized oocytes were sensitive to changes in
environmental conditions in the early period of IVC, sensitivity may have affected embryo
development. Moreover, Only-One Medium and Blastocyst Medium contain both essential and
non-essential amino acids. In contrast, Early Culture Medium contains only
alanyl-L-glutamine and taurine. Bavister and Arlotto [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] reported that addition of the 20 amino acids to hamster culture media overcame
the one-cell block. The morula block normally observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> cat
embryo development [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] may be due to the culture
conditions of the oocytes and embryos [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Whereas
Early Culture and Blastocyst media provide amino acids only after day 2, Only-One Medium
provides amino acids throughout the 7 days of culture. Therefore, Only-One Medium may be
superior to Early Culture and Blastocyst media in terms of supporting cat embryo development
during IVC.</p><p>These media also differ in terms of osmolarity. The osmolarity of Only-One Medium is 265
mOsm, and that of Early culture and Blastocyst media is 280 mOsm. The osmolarity of culture
media is a major factor affecting <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo development [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, NaCl is the major component of culture media
affecting osmolarity. As for other species [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the
development of feline embryos was improved under reduced NaCl concentrations [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, in our experiment, the low osmotic pressure
of Only-One Medium may have had a positive effect on embryogenesis.</p><p>It is well known that feline oocytes frequently show parthenogenesis [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, the proportion of parthenotes was 3.3 in Grade 1 and
2 oocytes and 7.9% in Grade 3 oocytes. Moreover, only one oocyte in each of the Grades
developed to the 8-cell stage using OM + BSA/FBS, and no oocyte developed to the morula or
blastocyst stage. We also evaluated the fertilization rate of Grade 1 and 2 oocytes and
Grade 3 oocytes, and observed 2PN formation in both groups. The results indicate that Grade
3 oocytes develop to the blastocyst stage due to normal fertilization and not
parthenogenesis.</p><p>Because blastocyst quality is evaluated in terms of blastocyst cell number [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], it is important to investigate cell numbers when
evaluating an IVC medium. Although we cultured embryos in OM + BSA/FBS for 7 days, the
average blastocyst cell number in the present study (235.4 &#x000b1; 87.7) is at least similar to
that reported by Herrick <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]
(121.0 &#x000b1; 8.8) who cultured embryos for 6 days and used cat-optimized culture medium with
serum in the late culture period.</p><p>In conclusion, the commercially available human Only-One Medium supplemented with BSA for
the first 2 days of culture and with FBS for the subsequent 5 days of culture is suitable
for feline embryo development until the blastocyst stage. Moreover, as the IVC condition was
effective for IVF of poor-quality oocytes, it can be a promising tool for use in the
conservation of endangered feline species. However, in the present study, we used media
provided by only one company, and did not compare them to media provided by other companies
and developed for other species. In the future, the effect of other commercially available
media on feline IVC should be investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pdf_001"><caption><title>Supplement table</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jvms-81-629-s001.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1204" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. Asako Nomura of the local veterinary clinic for
