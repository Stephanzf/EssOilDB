However, all skin layers are important to describe normal and dysfunctional skin conditions, and to develop adapted therapies or skin care products. In this work, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to image the spatial distribution of a variety of molecular species, from stratum corneum down to dermis, in cross-section samples of human abdominal skin. The results demonstrate the expected localization of ceramide and saturated long-chain fatty acids in stratum corneum (SC) and cholesterol sulfate in the upper part of the viable epidermis. The localization of exogenous compounds is demonstrated by the detection and imaging of carvacrol (a constituent of oregano or thyme essential oil) and ceramide, after topical application onto <italic>ex vivo</italic> human skin. Carvacrol showed pronounced accumulation to triglyceride-containing structures in the deeper parts of dermis. In contrast, the exogenous ceramide was found to be localized in SC. Furthermore, the complementary character of this approach with classical <italic>ex vivo</italic> skin absorption analysis methods is demonstrated.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The mammalian skin is a highly complex organ with a variety of advanced functions, one of the most important being to act as a barrier to excessive water loss, and xenobiotic and microbial assaults. A properly functioning barrier is essential for a healthy skin, but it also constitutes a challenge for the development of pharmaceutical and active cosmetic formulations, in which penetration of active compounds is crucial. Yet, for many cosmetic products such as UV filters, hair dyes, and hygiene products, penetration of the skin barrier is not desired and should be prevented. Other important functions of the skin include heat and tactile sensing, thermoregulation (sweat glands), UV protection (pigment cells) and immune response. Furthermore, the skin provides mechanical protection of the body, requiring both a hard surface and a soft, elastic connective tissue underneath<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The human skin varies in thickness according to body locations and is comprised of three distinct basic layers: the hypodermis, the dermis and the epidermis. Whereas the fat-rich hypodermis attaches to the underlying muscular tissue and provides padding and insulation for the body, dermis is composed of a dense connective tissue dominated by networks of collagen and elastin fibers within an extrafibrillar matrix of glucosaminoglycans and proteoglycans, giving strength and elasticity to the skin. Dermis also contains sensory organs, nerve endings, blood vessels, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicle roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In contrast to dermis, epidermis lacks vascular blood supply and is dominated by keratinocytes, which continuously migrate from the lower epidermal layer (stratum basale) under multiple differentiation stages towards the topmost epidermal layer, the stratum corneum (SC), where they are terminally transformed into flattened, keratin-rich, non-viable (dead) cells called corneocytes. The corneocytes in SC are interconnected by proteins called corneodesmosomes and arranged in single cell layers (10&#x02013;25 layers in human skin), of which the outer ones are constantly removed from the skin surface in a process called desquamation, in order to complete the continuously ongoing skin regeneration process. Furthermore, the corneocytes are coated with a cross-linked protein layer, the cornified envelope, onto which a lipid layer is covalently bound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The barrier properties of the skin are maintained by the unique molecular architecture of SC, in which the corneocyte layers are embedded in a structurally well-organized matrix of intercellular lipids, sometimes referred to as the &#x0201c;bricks-in-mortar&#x0201d; structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The composition of the lipid matrix is unique to SC and contains approximately 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol and 10&#x02013;20% free fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, where the latter are dominated by saturated long-chain fatty acids, mainly C24:0 and C26:0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and the ceramides are composed of at least 13 different subtypes, each with its own distribution of fatty acyl chain lengths, of which the major ones are also those containing 24 or 26 carbon atoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The lipids are organized in stacked bilayer structures, showing well-defined periodicities of 13&#x02009;nm (long periodicity phase) and 6&#x02009;nm (short periodicity phase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Importantly, it has been shown that disturbances in the lipid composition and/or organization can be related to changes in the barrier properties and to a range of skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis, lamellar ichthyosis and psoriasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The supply of lipids to SC is generated by so called lamellar bodies (LB), which are vesicular particles found at high concentrations in keratinocytes of the upper viable epidermis (stratum granulosum, SG). The LBs contain precursors of the SC lipids, which are released by exocytosis into the intercellular space at the SG/SC interface, together with enzymes for their final processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Another important skin lipid is cholesterol sulfate, which is believed to be involved in the keratinocyte differentiation and desquamation process. Cholesterol sulfate is primarily located to the upper part of the viable epidermis, with only low concentrations in SC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Passive penetration through SC has been found to depend critically on molecular weight, with the penetration being drastically reduced for molecules larger than 400&#x02013;500&#x02009;Da, and on the lipophilic properties of the substances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Different strategies have therefore been investigated to assist the delivery of pharmaceutical and cosmetic ingredients into the skin, including advanced formulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, penetration enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, chemical and physical methods to overcome the barrier (such as microneedles, ultrasound or electric cavitation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A common method to study the molecular penetration is to monitor the diffusion through the skin in a so-called Franz cell, in combination with analysis of different separated skin layers using, for example, mass spectrometry methods. This approach provides highly sensitive and quantitative concentration data, but the spatial information is limited to the various skin layers that can be isolated. Furthermore, various imaging techniques have been applied to obtain better spatial information, including CLSM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, FTIR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, Raman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, CARS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although these methods provide high spatial resolution, their sensitivities and chemical specificities are limited, which leads to uncertainties regarding the interpretation of the recorded images.</p><p id="Par6">Imaging mass spectrometry methods provide high chemical specificity and have also been used for skin analysis. Using MALDI imaging, a selection of endogenous lipids have been identified and mapped in skin cross sections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and, recently, the penetration of four drug molecules was successfully monitored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is another imaging mass spectrometry technique that has been used successfully for biomolecular imaging of cells and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The main advantage of ToF-SIMS is the spatial resolution, which is routinely in the submicrometer range, as compared to typically 10&#x02013;50&#x02009;&#x000b5;m for MALDI imaging, and the fact that no matrix deposition is needed for ToF-SIMS analysis. However, relatively few studies have been reported for ToF-SIMS analysis of skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Kezutyte <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and, more recently, Cizinauskas <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> used ToF-SIMS to study the effect of fatty acids and natural oils as penetration enhancers, while Starr <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> was able to characterize age-related changes in the abundance and spatial distribution of SC lipids by ToF-SIMS analysis of tape stripped skin samples. Whereas the spatial resolution is better for ToF-SIMS, the sensitivity is generally higher for MALDI imaging, as recently concluded from a MALDI imaging study of drug penetration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, which could be directly compared to a previous ToF-SIMS study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In this paper, ToF-SIMS was used to obtain unprecedented molecular imaging data of the major skin lipids together with the distribution of two topically applied exogenous compounds, carvacrol and ceramide. Whereas carvacrol is the main component of oregano and thyme essential oil (and has also been reported to be an efficient penetration enhancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>), ceramide is used in various topical formulations with the purpose to restore or maintain the lipid structure and composition in SC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, thereby alleviating problems with defective barrier function and dry skin. The ToF-SIMS analysis was combined with cutaneous absorption analysis using GC-MS and LC-MS, to obtain quantitative penetration data, and SEM imaging for structural correlation. The results demonstrate the simultaneous imaging of exogenous compounds and the endogenous lipid components in human skin cross sections at micrometre spatial resolution. This approach allows not only for analysis of molecular penetration, but also for monitoring the skin status in terms of lipid composition and distributions, as well as the effect of exogenous compounds on the endogenous lipid composition and distributions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mapping of endogenous lipids in skin cross sections</title><p id="Par8">The distribution of endogenous lipids within different skin layers was mapped at various length scales across the skin cross sections. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> displays ToF-SIMS data from an analysis covering the entire thickness of the skin, from the SC at the top to hypodermis at the lower edge of the cross section. The mass spectra show peaks from a range of specific lipids that are frequently observed also in other types of tissue, including phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidic acid (PA)), cholesterol and diacylglycerols (DAG), see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;b</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. The phospholipids are all relatively homogeneously distributed over the entire cross section, suggesting that these lipids represent cell membrane components throughout dermis and viable epidermis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Cholesterol (not shown) and typical protein fragments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) are also homogeneously distributed across the skin cross section, suggesting the same origin, although the protein signals may also be generated from collagen fibers, which could be observed by SEM throughout dermis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The DAG ions are assumed to represent triacylglycerol (TAG), since it is known that TAG is effectively fragmented in ToF-SIMS, producing mainly DAG ions and only low yields of intact TAG ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The DAG image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) shows strong localization to three parts of the skin cross section; (i) the upper edge of the cross section (at the skin surface), (ii) the bottom edge of the cross section (border to the hypodermis) and (iii) specific structures deep into dermis (further discussed in the next section). The fatty acid ions C16 and C18 (16 and 18 carbon atoms, respectively) are primarily fragments of phospholipids and TAG and should not be considered to represent free fatty acids.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Large-area ToF-SIMS data of skin cross section.

Whereas cholesterol sulfate shows appreciable signal in the upper &#x02248;200&#x02009;&#x000b5;m of the cross section, the C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids are present only at the very top edge, consistent with the known localization of these fatty acids to SC.</p><p id="Par10">Analyses focusing on the epidermis region of the skin cross section confirm the exclusive localization of the C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids to SC and cholesterol sulfate mainly to the epidermal region just below SC, i.e. the viable epidermis (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Furthermore, negative ion mass spectra generated exclusively from specific regions of the cross section, corresponding approximately to SC, viable epidermis and dermis, respectively (indicated in the total ion image of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), demonstrate a very different lipid composition of SC compared to the other two skin regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In the mass range m/z 650&#x02013;750, a number of peaks are observed in the SC spectrum that can be identified as molecular ions of some of the most abundant ceramides in SC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

The most abundant of these subclasses are NP, NH, AP and AH, where N and A refers to non-hydroxylated and hydroxylated fatty acid groups, respectively, and P and H refers to two different sphingoid bases, phytosphingosine and 4-hydroxysphingosine, respectively. Furthermore, the most abundant fatty acid chain lengths have been reported to be C24 and C26, with only small contributions from C16 and C18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and C18 being the most abundant chain length of the sphingoid base<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

However, since the P and H sphingosine base groups only differs stoichiometrically by one double bond, it is not possible to distinguish NH (or AH) with saturated carbon chains from NP (or AP) with one double bond in the carbon chains.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Negative ion ToF-SIMS data of the epidermal region of a skin cross section.

In the positive ion mode (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b,c</xref>), the exogenous ceramide was detected not only by the protonated molecular ion (m/z 566.56), which is the main peak of the pure ceramide reference spectrum in the mass range of the intact ceramide molecule, but also by two peaks at m/z 588.53 and 562.52, which can be assigned to sodium complexes of the intact ceramide molecule and of the ceramide molecule after loss of a minor fragment, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The latter assignment is motivated by the presence of the corresponding protonated ion at m/z 540.56 in, both, the skin cross section and ceramide reference spectra. The assignment of all these peaks to the exogenous ceramide is confirmed by their absence in spectra of the SC region in cross section samples of skin that has not been treated with the ceramide-containing formulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

Detailed inspection of the images shows that the three images representing SC lipids (cholesterol, ceramides and C24:0&#x02009;+&#x02009;C26:0 fatty acids, respectively) share a similar lateral distribution. Furthermore, the three images representing exogenous ceramide also display similar distributions. However, there is a small but consistent difference between the distributions of the exogenous ceramide and the SC lipids, in that most of the exogenous ceramide appears to be located slightly closer to the skin surface, whereas the signal at the deeper parts of SC are considerably lower (particularly evident in the 3-colour overlay images of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The different distributions of the exogenous ceramide and the SC lipids (green) thus indicate that the exogenous ceramide is not homogeneously distributed in SC, but rather exhibits a gradient with lower concentrations towards the bottom layers of SC.</p><p id="Par22">SEM analysis of the same area, and an overlay of the SEM and ToF-SIMS images (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b,c</xref>), provide additional information about the location of the exogenous ceramide. The SEM image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) shows that the analysis area corresponds to a skin cross section region where SC has been folded into the skin in a wrinkle structure and that the SC regions exposed for analysis display various characteristics: whereas parts of the exposed SC correspond to the characteristic layered structure of the SC cross section, a relatively large region appears to be a flattened part of the top SC surface. Furthermore, the ToF-SIMS overlay with the SEM image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) shows that the exogenous ceramide is mainly located to the SC region corresponding to the top SC surface, whereas the endogenous SC lipids are located mainly to the layered cross section region of SC, although both the exogenous and endogenous components produce significant signals in both regions. The observation that the exogeneous ceramide is mainly located to the top SC surface and thus not homogeneously distributed in SC indicates that ceramide does not easily penetrate into SC. Additional ToF-SIMS/SEM overlay images supporting this conclusion is provided in Supplementary Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>. These results are in good agreement with previous studies showing that the penetration of topically applied ceramides is limited to the superficial layers of SC, except in the presence of penetration enhancers or for very short carbon chains in the fatty acyl groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion and Conclusions</title><p id="Par23">In this work, the capabilities of a combined approach were demonstrated, using ToF-SIMS imaging together with cutaneous absorption quantification and SEM structural characterization. This approach provided information about the penetration and final localisation of topically applied compounds in <italic>ex vivo</italic> human skin, as well as the spatial and compositional distributions of some of the most abundant endogenous skin lipids. Spatial distributions consistent with prior knowledge were obtained for long-chain fatty acids and ceramides (stratum corneum) and for cholesterol sulfate (viable epidermis). Carvacrol (the main component of oregano essential oil) was found to effectively penetrate SC, but also to accumulate in fat-rich structures deep in dermis, such as residual adipocytes from hypodermis and possibly eccrine sweat glands. In contrast, topically applied ceramide was found by ToF-SIMS imaging to be exclusively located to SC, with an increased abundance at the upper layers of SC, whereas cutaneous absorption analysis showed the highest amounts in SC, but also significant quantities in the viable epidermis and dermis.</p><p id="Par24">The results show that ToF-SIMS can provide images of endogenous and exogenous compounds in skin cross sections with high specificity (compared to, e.g., optical microscopy and FTIR/Raman imaging) and at spatial resolutions down to the micrometer range. The use of skin cross sections allows for acquisition of overview images of large areas, followed by immediate detailed investigation of areas or structures of interest at different depths of the skin. Furthermore, subsequent analysis of the same areas/structures by SEM makes it possible to identify skin structures that may be related to features of the molecular images obtained by ToF-SIMS. While the chemical specificity and spatial resolution are the main advantages of ToF-SIMS, cutaneous absorption analysis provides better sensitivity and quantification capabilities than ToF-SIMS and is therefore an important complementary technique.</p><p id="Par25">For the carvacrol penetration study, a good agreement was observed between the GC-MS quantification and ToF-SIMS imaging, in both cases showing strong location to the dermis. 84%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.6 of the total amount of carvacrol in the skin was detected in dermis by GC-MS. However, ToF-SIMS imaging clearly showed that carvacrol was not homogenously distributed in dermis, as a clear colocalisation with structures dominated by triglycerides (and DAG) was observed. Although the identity of these structures cannot be conclusively assigned, their appearance and location deep in dermis may indicate that some of them are associated with the secretory coil of an eccrine sweat gland. However, carvacrol accumulation is also found for triglyceride-containing structures at the border to hypodermis, likely to be residual adipocytes. The effective penetration and strong affinity to triglyceride is consistent with the low molecular weight of carvacrol (150&#x02009;Da) and its strong lipophilic/hydrophobic properties.</p><p id="Par26">Upon ToF-SIMS imaging, exogenous ceramide was detected only in SC, and there was even a gradient showing lower concentration in the deeper SC layers (demonstrated by differences compared to the distributions of endogenous SC lipids), which is also consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In contrast, cutaneous absorption analysis showed significant amounts of ceramide in viable epidermis. This apparent contradiction may be related to the different sensitivities of the two methods. First, LC-MS showed considerably higher amounts of exogenous ceramide in SC compared to viable epidermis, suggesting that the amount in viable epidermis may be below the detection limit for ToF-SIMS. Second, the epidermal volume is about 10 times larger than the SC volume, indicating that the ceramide detected by LC-MS in viable epidermis may be up to tenfold diluted, which further reduces the concentration available for detection by ToF-SIMS. However, it has previously been pointed out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> that a potential problem of using tape stripping for sampling SC layers is that parts of the SC may not be completely removed, particularly in damaged regions or furrows in the skin, thus leaving some parts of the SC to be included in the analysis of the deeper skin layers. Since the ToF-SIMS images show that the exogeneous ceramide is preferentially located to skin furrows, we cannot exclude the possibility that the ceramide detected in viable epidermis in the cutaneous absorption analysis corresponds to such residues of SC. It is clear that further studies are needed to characterize the extent of ceramide penetration into and across SC.</p><p id="Par27">An important advantage of the presented approach using skin cross sections is the possibility to access the entire depth of the skin for detailed analysis of specific structures, and the clarity of the results that this provides with respect to the identity and location of specific molecular species in the skin. However, an important disadvantage is that only skin explants can be analysed, as opposed to fresh or viable skin. Also, the preparation of the cross-section samples is critical and can be problematic, especially considering that embedding of the skin sample should be avoided due to the added data complexity related to the strong organic signals generated by the embedding medium and the compromising effect that the embedding process may have on the lipid localisation. A final disadvantage of using cross section samples is that the sensitivity is probably lower than that of direct analysis of the skin surface, e.g., through analysis of successive tape strips<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. However, it is likely that the sensitivity can be improved for the analysis of cross sections by the use of argon cluster ion sputtering, which would increase the sample volume (i.e., depth) available for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Skin samples and topical formulations</title><p id="Par28">Normal abdominal human skin from anonymous healthy female donors was obtained during plastic surgery procedures according to the French regulations (article L. 1243-4 of the French public Health Code) and Declaration of Helsinki act.

Absolute quantification of analyte concentrations is difficult in ToF-SIMS because the measured secondary ion yields depend not only on analyte concentration but also on other factors, such as matrix effects (and internal calibration is usually not possible).
