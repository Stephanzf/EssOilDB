This study presents a concept for the first eco-friendly enzymatic synthesis of economically important fatty acid sugar esters based on lignocellulosic biomass. To achieve this, beech wood cellulose fiber hydrolysate was applied in three manners: as sugar component, as part of the deep eutectic solvent (DES) reaction system and as carbon source for the microbial production of the fatty acid component. These fatty acids were gained from single cell oil produced by the oleaginous yeast <italic>Cryptococcus curvatus</italic> cultivated with cellulose fiber hydrolysate as carbon source. Afterwards, an immobilized <italic>Candida antarctica</italic> lipase B was used as the biocatalyst in DES to esterify sugars with fatty acids. Properties of the DES were determined and synthesized sugar mono- and di-esters were identified and characterized using TLC, MS, and NMR. Using this approach, sugar esters were successfully synthesized which are 100% based on lignocellulosic biomass.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Cryptococcus curvatus</italic></kwd><kwd>single cell oil</kwd><kwd>lignocellulose</kwd><kwd>sugar esters</kwd><kwd>synthesis</kwd><kwd>deep eutectic solvents</kwd><kwd>biorefinery</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Ministerium f&#x000fc;r Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003542</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">7533-10-5-85A</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">Pro2NMR</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001656</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">BIFTM</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="9159"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With an estimated production of 120&#x02013;140 billion tons per year, lignocellulose constitutes the most abundant organic material in the world. Lignocellulose is the main component of woody and grass-like biomass and consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, containing up to 75% of carbohydrates and therefore, it is excellently suited as a substrate for a biorefinery (Herrera, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Pauly and Keegstra, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Cherubini, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; FitzPatrick et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In contrast to renewable resources of the first generation, these carbohydrates are not competing with food production. They are a valuable substrate for both biotechnological and (bio-)chemical processes but require previous fractionation. By applying the physico-chemical organosolv process the three main components from lignocellulose can be separated using an aqueous-organic solvent system under high pressure and temperature. The cellulose fiber fraction can be subsequently saccharified enzymatically yielding a glucose-rich hydrolysate, which is highly suitable as a microbial carbon source, as a building block or as a pre-cursor for other (fine-)chemicals (Nigam, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Laure et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; D&#x000f6;rsam et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules, which occur in numerous products of daily life in food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals (&#x00160;abeder et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Marchant and Banat, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Fatty acid sugar esters (a.k.a. glycolipids) are a class of surfactants, based on a sugar moiety and a fatty acid tail. Compared to other surfactant classes, they are commonly biodegradable, non-toxic and environmentally friendly being very mild and skin-friendly at the same time (Chang and Shaw, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Synthesis of sugar esters can be performed by chemical processes as well as by microbial or enzymatic conversions (Ducret et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). However, only enzymatic synthesis enables sustainable production of tailor-made sugar esters. Enzymatic synthesis of fatty acid sugar esters based on sugar and fatty acids or their respective esters is often catalyzed by esterases or lipases in reaction media of low water activity (P&#x000f6;hnlein et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Under these conditions, the hydrolytic activity of both enzyme classes is reversed and ester bonds are formed between the hydroxyl group of a sugar molecule and the carboxyl group of the fatty acid (Zaks and Klibanov, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Klibanov, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Esterification of sugar and fatty acid can take place in different reaction media, e.g., certain organic solvents, ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents (DES). DES offer several advantages, as non-flammable, cheap, biodegradable and easy to produce. In general, DES consists of a mixture of a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt and a hydrogen bond donor. By interaction of both components the melting point of the mixture is strongly decreased resulting in a solution which is often liquid at room temperature (Abbott et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Durand et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Tang and Row, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Since it was shown by Gorke et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), that hydrolases like esterases and lipases show high activity in deep eutectic solvents consisting of the ammonium salts choline chloride (CC) or ethylammonium chloride with different hydrogen bond donors, many other successful enzymatic reactions in DES were reported (Xu et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study it was shown, that various sugars can act simultaneously as hydrogen bond donor for the DES formation, and as substrate for the enzymatic sugar ester production (Siebenhaller et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Further, it was shown, that fatty acid vinyl esters with different chain length are suitable acyl chains. Siebenhaller et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) demonstrated that it is possible to use a cellulose fiber hydrolysate from beech wood as a sugar resource for both, enzymatic reaction and DES component, to synthesize sugar esters with a fossil-oil based fatty acid tail. To increase sustainability of the product, a renewable source for fatty acids or fatty acid esters like plant oil or microbial oil (&#x0201c;single cell oil,&#x0201d; SCO) can be used. In contrast to plant oils, microbial lipids can be produced independent from season, climate and location; they do not require arable land and a wide range of carbon sources, e.g., waste streams from food industry or renewable carbon sources, can be used for their production (Ochsenreither et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). SCOs are produced by oleaginous microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, microalgae or filamentous fungi) which are able to accumulate 20&#x02013;80% lipid per dry biomass in the stationary growth phase under nutrient limitations, e.g., nitrogen or phosphate, and coincident excess of carbon source (Ratledge, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The basidiomycetous yeast <italic>Cryptococcus curvatus</italic> belongs to one of the best studied oleaginous microorganisms. Under optimized conditions, <italic>C. curvatus</italic> accumulates up to 60% lipid per dry biomass (Ratledge, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Previous studies showed that <italic>C. curvatus</italic> can utilize waste streams from industry, e.g., distillery or brewery waste, to produce SCO (Gonzales-Garcia et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ryu et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Additionally, some hydrolysates, such as dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysates of wheat straw (with emphasis on acetate utilization) (Yu et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and alkaline-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate (resulting in ~30% (w/w) lipid content) (Gong et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) have been used as a substrate.</p><p>However, to the best of our knowledge, enzymatically saccharified beech wood cellulose fiber has not been studied so far as a suitable carbon source for lipid production by <italic>C. curvatus</italic>.</p><p>The aim of the presented concept was to produce fatty acid sugar esters from completely renewable resources using eco-friendly enzymatic catalysis. The choice of DES as a reaction medium offers a green alternative and therefore characteristics of the solvent were determined. In this system, the synthesis of sugar esters can be carried out using the immobilized <italic>Candida antarctica</italic> lipase B (iCalB). The successful formation was proven by NMR and MALDI-ToF analysis. This set-up, together with sugars and fatty acids based on beech wood cellulose fiber hydrolysate, enables the production of surfactants of 100% renewable origin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of beech wood cellulose fiber hydrolysate</title><p>Chopped beech wood was incubated at temperatures &#x0003e;140&#x000b0;C in aqueous ethanol solution with a small amount of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as catalyst to obtain different fractions (acid-catalyzed organosolv process). After washing, the fiber fraction, mainly containing the cellulose and a part of hemicellulose, was directly subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the fiber was performed for 24 h at a temperature of 50&#x000b0;C with a 10% (w/v) suspension. For stirrer description see Ludwig et al. (Ludwig et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). pH of the suspension was adjusted to pH 4.8 during hydrolysis using a concentrated NaOH solution. The hydrolysis reaction started by adding 60 mg Cellic&#x000ae; CTec3 and 2.5 mg Cellic&#x000ae; HTec3 per g cellulose. Solid material was removed afterwards applying an extruder press. The successive concentration of the filtrate resulted in the following mono- and disaccharide concentrations: 30.8 g/L cellobiose, 89.7 g/L xylose and 608.3 g/L glucose quantified via chromatographic analysis (see Sluiter et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref> for further description). Analysis furthermore revealed the absence of toxic or degradation products.</p><p>The obtained cellulose hydrolysate was directly used as carbon source for SCO production. For the preparation of DES, however, it had to be further purified and dried: The cellulose hydrolysate was diluted in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (1:2 w/v) and 1 g activated carbon per 5 mL solution was added. After rigorous shaking for 1 min, the activated carbon mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Succeeding purification, activated carbon was separated by a two-step filtration process (pore size 4&#x02013;7 and 0.22 &#x003bc;m). Afterwards, the solution was spray dried in a werco&#x000ae; SD-20 spray dryer (input temperature 182&#x000b0;C, output temperature 74&#x02013;81&#x000b0;C; Hans G. Werner Industrietechnik, Reutlingen, Germany) resulting in a final water content of 8%, determined by Karl Fischer titration (TitroLine&#x000ae; 7500 KF trace, SI Analytics, Mainz, Germany). Mono- and disaccharide concentrations were analyzed by HPLC (see section Analysis of Bioreactor Samples).</p></sec><sec><title>Production of single cell oil in a bioreactor</title><sec><title>Strain and medium</title><p>For the production of single cell oil, <italic>C. curvatus</italic> ATCC 20509 was used.

Organic phase extraction with the same volume of ethyl acetate resulted in the accumulation of sugar esters after 45 s of mixing.

To enhance extraction efficiency, the addition of ethyl acetate with subsequent mixing can be repeated up to five times.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Purification of fatty acid sugar esters by flash chromatography</title><p>Before further analysis via mass spectrometry and NMR, eight extracts from identical synthesis reactions were unified and purified via flash chromatography (Reveleris Prep, B&#x000fc;chi Labortechnik GmbH, Germany). The extract was mixed with 2 g of silica (40 &#x003bc;m pore size) and liquid was subsequently evaporated in a rotary evaporator. The silica including the bound components (products and excess of sugar and FAMEs) were packed in an empty column. For separation, a Reveleris HP Silica 4 g column and a flow rate of 15 mL/min was used. As method, the dry sample function was selected and a gradient of chloroform and methanol was used as follows: 0&#x02013;7% methanol in 1 min, holding the gradient for 7 min, followed by an increase to 15% methanol in 2 min and holding it for 1 min with subsequent increase to 20% in 1 min. To eluate sugars and other polar components, the gradient was set to 100% methanol in 1 min holding it for 4 min. Peaks were observed by an evaporative light scattering detector (Threshold: 30 mV, Sensitivity: low) and fractions collected. Unprocessed fractions were analyzed via TLC and divided into three samples (1 = fraction 6&#x02013;9, 2 = fraction 14+15+17, 3 = fraction 16). For ESI-Q-ToF MS, MALDI-ToF MS and NMR analysis the samples were evaporated.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of fatty acid sugar esters</title><sec><title>Qualitative detection of fatty acid sugar esters via thin-layer chromatography</title><p>As a fast qualitative detection method of the formed sugar esters, 10 &#x003bc;L extracts were spotted onto a 60 &#x000c5; silica gel TLC plate (Alugram Xtra SIL G, Macherey-Nagel GmbH &#x00026; Co.KG, D&#x000fc;ren, Germany).

In a first step, the production of single cell oil based on cellulose fiber fraction and their transesterification to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) is reported (3.1). For the enzymatic esterification the DES reaction system consisting of cellulose fiber monosaccharides and choline chloride was prepared and characterized (3.2). Besides as part of the solvent, these monosaccharides act also as substrate for the enzymatic biosurfactant production and are linked to the added FAMEs by iCalB lipase. The successful formation of sugar esters were qualitatively proven by TLC (3.3), mass analysis (3.4) and NMR (3.5).

Biomass content increased from 0.4 g/L dry biomass to ~45 g/L dry biomass after 72 h of cultivation. After each addition of carbohydrates, a steep increase of biomass was observed. During carbon source consumption, dissolved oxygen concentration dropped quickly (data not shown) until the carbon source was depleted. Since carbon source was limited between feeding cycles, biomass concentration stagnated or was slightly reduced due to sampling and the dilution of culture broth because of feeding. After feeding at 79 h, biomass dropped considerably and did not increase again. Probably due to the high lipid content of the cells at that time, the cell pellet was very soft and cells started to float. Therefore, solid-liquid separation by centrifugation was not efficient and dry biomass concentration might be higher than given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> at the end of cultivation.</p><p>Accumulation of single cell oil started after nitrogen depletion at ~24 h of cultivation time. Lipid content increased from ~12% (w/w) to ~48% (w/w) of dry biomass after 96 h showing the steepest increase between 30 and 60 h of cultivation time. The final fatty acid profile analyzed via GC revealed a composition of 44.6% oleic acid (C18:1), 35.1% palmitic acid (C16:0), 12.6% stearic acid (C18:0) and 6.2% linoleic acid (C18:2). Myristic acid (C14:0) has been detected only in trace amounts (0.77%); all other fatty acids add up to 0.74%. In total, 256.5 g of carbohydrates have been consumed during the cultivation.</p><p>The successful production of single cell oil with <italic>C. curvatus</italic> based on beech wood cellulose fiber hydrolysate is one of the major outcomes of this study and was shown for the first time. The used fiber hydrolysate consists of a carbohydrate mixture with glucose (608.3 g/L), xylose (89.7 g/L) and cellobiose (30.8 g/L) as the major components. Glucose is likely the most preferred carbon source of <italic>C. curvatus</italic>, however, xylose and cellobiose did not accumulate in culture medium and were completely consumed before the next feeding. The ability of <italic>C. curvatus</italic> to consume xylose and cellobiose as well as a mixture of these two carbon sources with glucose has already been demonstrated by Yu et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). They demonstrated that cellobiose and xylose can be consumed simultaneously with similar rates, but their consumption is inhibited in the presence of glucose. In a mixture of all three sugars (in pure form) the composition of the mixture had only little impact on the total sugar consumption rate. However, the consumption rate of glucose was considerably higher than the consumption rates of both other sugars. In the presence of a low glucose concentration, i.e., 10 g/L and lower, consumption of xylose and cellobiose seemed to be not affected (Yu et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Due to the sampling interval in our study, the exact threshold concentration of glucose cannot be confirmed. However, in preliminary studies in shake flasks it was observed, that xylose accumulated in the medium because glucose was not exhausted before feeding (results not shown). In the study of Yu et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) the composition of the carbon source did not significantly affect lipid content and composition. Lipid content ranged in all approaches from 38.7 to 40.3% lipid per dry biomass with oleic acid being the main fatty acid (41.3&#x02013;44.8%) which resembles our results very closely.</p><p>Although production of single cell oil is generally possible with all kinds of sugars and various other carbon sources, yields and productivity are usually best when using pure glucose. Therefore, the cultivation with glucose is also used as benchmark for this study. Compared to cultivations with pure glucose as described by Dillschneider et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the results of the present study concerning lipid content (~48% in this study vs. 45.3% (w/w)) is very similar. However, concerning the lipid composition (oleic acid: 44.6% in this study vs. 48.8%; linoleic acid: 6.2 in this study vs. 8.6%; palmitic acid: 35.1% in this study vs. 18.5% and stearic acid 12.6% in this study vs. 17.7%), a higher content of palmitic acid was produced at the expense of oleic acid, linoleic acid, stearic acid and lignoceric acid, which was not detected in the presented study. The prominent shift in the fatty acid profile toward C16:0 compounds might be explained due to the use of carbohydrate mixtures in our study compared to pure glucose in the study of Dillschneider et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, this is not supported by the study of Yu et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) as they also used different carbohydrate mixtures and did only observe a very slight shift in fatty acid profile. Another possible reason might be the presence of by-products in the cellulose fiber fraction due to the organosolv pretreatment, e.g., furfural or HMF. These compounds can be detoxified by the cells, but the mechanisms require the coenzymes NADH or NADPH (J&#x000f6;nsson et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). For SCO production, high amounts of NADPH are needed, for each addition of a C2 unit 2 NADPH molecules have to be spent (Ratledge, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Therefore, it might be possible, that detoxification of by-products might influence the fatty acid composition of SCO toward shorter fatty acid chain lengths.</p><p>Furthermore, yield coefficients for biomass (Y<sub>x/s</sub>) and lipid production (Y<sub>p/s</sub>) were calculated in the presented study to 0.21 g dry biomass per g carbon source and 0.10 g lipid per g carbon source. In comparison, Dillschneider et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) achieved a higher Y<sub>X/S</sub> of 0.30 and a slightly higher Y<sub>P/S</sub> of 0.13 using glucose as sole carbon source, i.e., pure glucose can be converted more efficiently to biomass and lipids as the carbohydrates from fiber hydrolysate which also supports our hypothesis that some energy is needed for detoxification of the fiber hydrolysate Although the lipid content is comparable of pure glucose and fiber hydrolysate cultivation, the much higher biomass concentration in the pure glucose cultivation results in much higher total lipid amount (34.5 g produced lipid with pure glucose vs. 21.5 g produced lipid with fiber hydrolysate). All relevant data of the presented cultivation with cellulose fiber hydrolysate are summarized in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and compared to the study of Dillschneider et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In summary, it was shown that cellulose fiber hydrolysate from organosolv process can be used as a suitable glucose alternative for the lipid production with <italic>C. curvatus</italic>. Cultivating with pure glucose or a mixture of the three sugars present in our hydrolysate in pure form, results in comparable lipid content making the hydrolysate a very promising substrate for an emerging bioeconomy.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of measured and calculated process parameters of SCO production with <italic>C. curvatus</italic> ATCC 20509 using cellulose fiber hydrolysate from beech wood in comparison to batch cultivations with pure glucose.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Cellulose fiber hydrolysate</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Glucose (Dillschneider et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)<sup>*</sup></bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cultivation time [h]</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">96</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">120</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Consumed C-source [g]</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">256.5</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not given</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lipid content [% (w/w)]</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47.9</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dry biomass conc.

In a previous work using the same DES, a pH of 7.5 and water content of 5.4% were already determined (Siebenhaller et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In addition to these data, a water activity of 0.101 was measured. The water molecules did not occur in a free form; they are part of the hydrogen bond network of the DES system. Therefore, the water should not be available to perform the hydrolysis of formed sugar ester. To a certain degree, the presence of water molecules may help to maintain the enzymes&#x02018; essential hydrate shell or have other effects on the system like lowering the viscosity. This positive effect to enzymatic reactions was already reported by other groups(Durand et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Guajardo et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>The viscosity of sugar-based DES is very high and depends on the sugar used, the molar ratio, the water content and the temperature. A similar DES to the one used here, CC:Glu in a molar ratio of 1:1, had a viscosity of 34,400 mPa<sup>*</sup>s at 50&#x000b0;C (Maugeri and Dom&#x000ed;nguez de Mar&#x000ed;a, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The DES is this study consisting of one part CC and one part sugar (glucose and xylose) is less viscous with 2.540 mPa<sup>*</sup>s. A reason could be the water content of 5.4%, which will reduce the viscosity of a DES (Shah and Mjalli, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Further, a nearly 10 times higher viscosity of 23.340 mPa<sup>*</sup>s was determined at 25&#x000b0;C, which also indicates the highly temperature depending viscosity of DES (Maugeri and Dom&#x000ed;nguez de Mar&#x000ed;a, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Stefanovic et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The relative low viscosity of the DES may help to increase the mass transfer, which can lead to higher enzymatic reaction yields.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of synthesized products via thin-layer chromatography</title><p>For the production of sugar ester, a DES consisting of choline chloride and purified cellulose hydrolysate fraction was prepared and produced FAMEs from SCO and iCalB were added for the synthesis of sugar esters. As a fast analysis of the crude fatty acid sugar ester extract, TLC was performed to detect expected sugar esters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Synthesis products in this extract showed various spots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The spot with the retention factor (RF) 0 is a mixture of glucose (dark gray) and xylose (yellow) of the DES, verified by a standard of the pure sugars (data not shown). The light gray-yellowish spots between RF 0.05 and 0.42 indicate the formation of different glucose- and xylose-esters. The height of each spot depends on the chain length and saturation state of the sugar esters carbonyl chain. In this area, a clear spot with a RF 0.08 seems to be the main product of the enzymatic reaction. Above, two dark purple spots with RF 0.75 and 0.92 are visible. These spots are fatty acid methyl esters which were not consumed during the synthesis reaction.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Lipase catalyzed transesterification reaction in the DES with sugar (e.g., glucose) and a methylated fatty acid ester produced from SCO (methyl myristate, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate and methyl linoleate).

Sample 1 as well as sample 2 show the same spot pattern according to TLC analysis. Therefore, sample 1 and 2 were unified and concentrated. Sample 3 resulted in the clearest spot and was therefore regarded as being the purest fraction of the main product and, consequently, was used for NMR analysis.</p><p>In both purified fractions, only trace amounts of FAMEs are visible at the running front. Sample 2 contains the main product, a clear gray colored spot portending to a glucose-ester with a slight yellow aura, indicating for a xylose-ester. The comparison of the height of these spots to known sugar esters led to the assumption that they are sugar-monoesters (Siebenhaller et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The analysis of sample 1 showed a gray-yellow striped pattern between RF 0.17 and 0.25. The there-in contained products have either a much longer hydrophobic carbonyl chain, which is unlikely with the FAME-composition applied in our study, or two or more fatty acids are bound to the polar sugar.</p><p>During transesterification of a FAME and a sugar, methanol is formed as a side-product. Methanol can enter the gas phase and push the reaction toward acylation but in a sealed reaction vessel and with a boiling point of 64&#x000b0;C, most of the methanol will likely stay in the DES. However, methanol has been reported to inhibit the activity of the lipase (Coulon et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).</p><p>To overcome that, the reaction efficiency might be improved by increasing the temperature to &#x0003e;65&#x000b0;C, taking care that the enzyme remains still active. By using other fatty acids like vinyl esters, acetaldehyde will be formed as side product, which evaporates much easier at lower temperatures (Bornscheuer and Yamane, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). However, the vinylation reaction is much more complicated than the methylation of fatty acids. Another method of optimization would be to carry out the process at reduced pressure to remove side products immediately and shift the reaction equilibrium (Ducret et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>).</p><p>The successful formation of mono- or polyacylated sugars in this DES system with the used iCalB and commercial available vinyl esters was already shown (Siebenhaller et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>); the synthesis with sustainable fatty acid methyl esters for the production of fatty acid sugar ester was verified by subsequent mass spectrometry and NMR analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Mass analysis of the formed sugar esters</title><p>The successful enzymatic synthesis of sugar esters were affirmed by three different mass analysis procedures. All these methods were necessary to identify clearly the sugar esters, as they have different strengths and weaknesses. First, with the TLC-MALDI-ToF technique it was possible to assign product spots of sample 1 and 2 to a detected <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value. In the lane of sample 1, masses were detected in three areas. Surprisingly, in area 1 (A1: RF 0.59&#x02013;0.67) and area 2 (A2: RF 0.72-.082) the same <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values were determined (Supplement <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>). Several <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values of sodium adducts of glucose-di-esters with the following fatty acid pairs were identified: <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 680.04 (myristic acid/stearic acid or more likely palmitic acid/palmitic acid), <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 706.47 (palmitic acid/oleic acid), <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 708.09 (palmitic acid/stearic acid), <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 727.66 (linoleic acid/linoleic acid) and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 734.10 (stearic acid/oleic acid). Throughout the entire area 3 (A3: RF 0.86&#x02013;0.88), only <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 686.0 was detected, which corresponds to a protonated glucose, acylated with palmitic acid and stearic acid. Due to the high number of potentially formed sugar-di-esters, more possible combinations are feasible. So it is possible, that <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 680.04 corresponds to a protonated xylose, which is linked to 2 oleic acids, or to stearic acid/linoleic acid.</p><p>By applying sample 2 onto the silica plate and subsequent analysis, two mass areas (a1; RF 0.33&#x02013;0.45 and a2: RF 0.84&#x02013;0.89) were found. In a1, sodium adducts of the more polar reaction products glucose palmitate (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 441.66) glucose oleate (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 467.71) and glucose stearate (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 469.74) were detected. a2 indicates the presence of more hydrophobic glucose-di-esters, which was expected due to the TLC separation. One of these di-ester corresponds to a protonated glucose with palmitic acid and stearic acid (m/z 686.04), the other di-ester matched to the sodium adduct of a glucose, linked to 2 linoleic acids (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 727.61). These results show that the enzymatic synthesis was successful.</p><p>Due to possible matrix and silica problems by the detection of molecules with low masses, ESI-Q-ToF MS were performed to verify the results.</p><p>By applying ESI-Q-ToF MS to sample 2 various sugar-mono-esters were identified. The synthesis of glucose palmitate (M<sub>GP</sub> = 418.29 Da) was verified through the occurrence of ions at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 441.27 (M<sub>GP</sub> + Na<sup>+</sup>), <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 436.30 (M<sub>GP</sub> + <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>), <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 401.26 (M<sub>GP</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sup>+</sup>) and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 383.23 (M<sub>GP</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sup>+</sup>). The same adducts of glucose oleate (M<sub>GO</sub> = 444.31 Da) were detected at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 467.27, 462.32, 427.26 and 409.27. Further, glucose stearate (M<sub>GS</sub> = 446.32 Da) and glucose linoleate (M<sub>GL</sub> = 442.29 Da) was detected through the ions M<sub>GS</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sup>+</sup> (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 429.29) respective M<sub>GL</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sup>+</sup> (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 425.25). Thus, it was possible to detect sugar esters of the most common FAMEs.</p><p>In addition, a MALDI-ToF MS of sample 1 was accomplished to verify the occurrence of sugar-di- or poly-ester with higher masses, which couldn't be detected via ESI-Q-ToF MS and to overcome possible problems of the TLC-silica. There, masses corresponding to synthesized sugar-di-esters were detected, too. Sodium adducts with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 733.56, <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 731.55, <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 705.52, and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 679.55 indicates the formation of glucose-di-ester with the following acylated fatty acid pairs: stearic acid/oleic acid (712.58 Da), stearic acid/linoleic acid (708.55 Da), oleic acid/oleic acid (708.55 Da), palmitic acid/oleic acid (682.53 Da) and palmitic acid/palmitic acid (656.52 Da). At <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 699.5, the sodium adducts of a di-acylated xylose with oleic acid/linoleic acid (676.53 Da) shows, that xylose was used as a substrate, too.</p><p>The results of the mass analysis confirmed the formation of sugar esters in the used DES with FAMEs.</p><p>Beside the mentioned products, other sugar-mono- and di-esters might be formed. Since it is shown in literature, it cannot be excluded that sugar-poly-ester were also synthesized in this reaction system, even if none were detected (Siebenhaller et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Since many products or their adducts have the same mass, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between them. It can only be stated that, based on the FAME-mixture used and the amount of fatty acids contained therein, some sugar esters will be probably less common than others. Sugar esters with the four main fatty acids (palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid) were detected; therefore, the used FAME-Mix is a suitable substrate for this reaction.</p><p>It was possible to identify some xylose esters in fraction 1 via MALDI-ToF MS, but these are much rarer than glucose ester. Since glucose occurs 4-times more often than xylose in the purified and dried cellulose fraction, this is justified.</p><p>Mass spectra are shown in the Supplement <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of sugar ester structure by NMR</title><p>The purified and fractionated sample 3 of an iCalB catalyzed synthesis reaction in a DES, based on lignocellulosic sugars, with FAMEs, was investigated with one and two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra.

It was shown, that cellulose fiber hydrolysate from organosolv process is a suitable substrate for SCO production with <italic>C. curvatus</italic> being completely comparable to pure sugars regarding biomass and lipid content. Subsequently, a DES reaction system based on sugars of the hydrolysate was established, acting simultaneously as reaction media and together with the produced fatty acids as substrate for the enzymatic sugar ester synthesis. The successful formation of sugar esters were proven by NMR analysis. Further, several sugar (di-)esters like glucose palmitate or oleate and glucose di- linoleic acid were detected by various MS experiments. For a better understanding of the reaction media characteristics of the used DES were determined.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SS performed experiments, conceived the work, worked on coordination of experiments and supervised JK.
