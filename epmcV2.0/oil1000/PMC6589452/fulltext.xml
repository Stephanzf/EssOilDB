All cats were assigned to either a control food: Royal Canin Renal Support A Feline, dry or a test food: Hill&#x02019;s Prescription Diet k/d Feline with chicken, dry. Food intake was recorded daily; body weight weekly; and serum, urine, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and body condition assessments were performed at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months. Twenty cats (9 control, 11 test group) completed the study according to protocol. Cats consuming control food had significant loss of body weight (n=14; mean, &#x02212;13.0 per cent, P&#x0003c;0.0001) and lean body mass (LBM; mean, &#x02212;11.1 per cent, P&#x0003c;0.0001) over the 6-month feeding period, whereas cats consuming test food had a significant increase in body weight (n=14; mean, 5.8 per cent, P=0.003) and no change in LBM (P=0.42). Cats consumed 23 per cent more calories (P=0.05) when fed test food (mean, 207.1 kcal/day) compared with cats fed control food (mean, 168.0 kcal/day). Serum creatinine increased at a faster rate (P=0.0004) in cats consuming control food compared with cats consuming test food. Cats consuming test food had increased caloric and essential amino acid intake, increased body weight, stable biomarkers of kidney function and maintained LBM compared with cats consuming control food.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cats</kwd><kwd>kidneys</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an irreversible disease, which results in progressive loss of renal function, and may eventually lead to a uraemic crisis and death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In a recent study of randomly selected cats from a single feline-only practice, the prevalence of CKD in cats 5&#x02013; 15 years of age was &#x0003e;40 per cent, with a higher prevalence (80&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent) among cats&#x000a0;&#x0003e;15 years.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Data from IDEXX Laboratories in the USA, from approximately 1.1&#x02009;million cats with serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentrations measured since July 2015, indicate that overall prevalence of CKD is 28&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent, and prevalence increases with age (67&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent in cats&#x000a0;&#x0003e;18 years).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition, over two times the number of cats can be diagnosed with CKD using serum SDMA concentrations as opposed to serum creatinine concentrations alone.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This is because serum SDMA detects CKD earlier when serum creatinine is still normal,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and because it is not negatively impacted by loss of lean body mass (LBM) with ageing.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Serum creatinine declines with age because of muscle wasting, whereas SDMA increases as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines with age.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Cats with CKD are staged according to guidelines developed by the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) and accepted by the American and European Societies of Veterinary Nephrology and Urology. The IRIS stages range from no azotemia (IRIS&#x000a0;stage 1) to the most severe azotemia (IRIS&#x000a0;stage 4). Staging guidelines are helpful for making diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic recommendations for CKD.</p><p>Currently, feeding a renal food to cats with IRIS stage 2 CKD or higher is considered the standard of care with strong evidence supporting this recommendation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> In one study, feeding a renal food was better than an adult maintenance food for minimizing uraemic episodes and kidney-related deaths in cats with IRIS stage 2 or 3 CKD.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In another study, cats fed any of seven commercial foods designed for cats with CKD had longer median survival times (16 months) compared with cats fed conventional foods (7 months).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Typical renal protective foods have reduced protein, phosphorus and sodium content, increased caloric density, increased buffering capacity and increased soluble fibre, B-complex vitamins, antioxidants and (n-3) fatty acids (FA).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Feline kidney foods are supplemented with potassium.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Such foods meet the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO, 2017 Official Publication) minimum recommendations for protein.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The goals of nutritional therapy are to slow progressive loss of kidney function, reduce clinical and biochemical consequences of CKD and maintain adequate nutrition.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Nutritional management of CKD is also recommended if persistent proteinuria, for example, urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio&#x000a0;&#x0003e;0.4, or hyperphosphataemia (&#x0003e;4.6&#x02009;mg/dl) exists in stage 1 CKD.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, in a recent clinical study, client-owned geriatric cats with IRIS stage 1 CKD (without proteinuria or hyperphosphataemia) that were fed a food designed to promote healthy ageing were more likely to demonstrate stable renal function compared with cats fed owner&#x02019;s-choice foods over a 6-month period.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Cats fed owner&#x02019;s-choice foods were more likely to demonstrate progressive renal insufficiency.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Using the serum SDMA test, it is now possible to identify these cats with CKD before azotemia develops. These data suggest that renal foods are beneficial for cats with IRIS stage 1 CKD.</p><p>Although renal therapeutic foods have been recommended for decades with the expectation that they would alleviate clinical signs of uraemia and slow progression of CKD, their clinical effectiveness and nutritional impact recently have been challenged.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Some veterinarians have even suggested that cats with CKD should be fed high-protein foods as a strategy to preserve muscle mass.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A major concern is that dietary interventions that benefit renal function in non-azotemic cats with reduced GFR, for&#x000a0;example, IRIS&#x000a0;stage 1 CKD, have not been well studied. In addition, guidelines extrapolated from data derived from dialysis-dependent people consuming less than their protein requirements, as well as studies in other species such as dogs and rodents, may not be relevant to cats.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The purpose of this study was to provide prospective, clinical&#x000a0;trial data on dietary management of cats with CKD using commercially available therapeutic renal&#x000a0;support foods. The goal was to determine if a therapeutic renal food with controlled protein and phosphorus, increased caloric density, an enhanced essential amino acid profile, added L-carnitine, fish oil, antioxidants and enhanced palatability<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> could help cats maintain body weight and muscle mass over a 6-month period compared with cats fed a control food having a similar protein content, but different composition. Test food was a high-quality protein food that contained less protein than maintenance foods but was fortified with essential amino acids, thus exceeding the AAFCO minimum recommendation for protein and amino acids (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), low phosphorus, antioxidant-enriched food. The hypothesis of this study was that cats consuming test food would maintain or show improved status of serum renal biomarkers (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and SDMA concentrations) and urinalysis parameters (urine-specific gravity (USG) and UPC ratio) across time compared with cats fed control food. In addition, it was hypothesised that cats fed test food would consume more calories, and maintain body weight and LBM compared with cats fed control food over the 6-month study period.</p><table-wrap

Cats were eligible if they were between 2 and 16 years of age. Both males and females were included (all gonadectomised); all breeds were eligible and there were no initial body weight restrictions. Fifty-seven cats were screened for CKD (physical examination, blood work and urinalysis) of which 28 cats were enrolled in the study. Cats had to be in good general health based on physical examination and laboratory analyses, with a body condition score (BCS) of 2/5 or greater, and could only consume dry food during the trial. Cats had to have increased SDMA concentration (&#x0003e;13.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/dl), and could have one or more of the following: increased serum creatinine concentration (&#x0003e;1.6&#x02009;mg/dl), abnormal kidney on palpation, dilute urine with USG&#x0003c;1.035 or UPC ratio&#x000a0;&#x0003e;0.4. Cats were not eligible for the study if diagnosed with a systemic illness other than CKD, were having planned surgery, were pregnant or likely to become pregnant during the study period or had fractious behaviour. After screening, cats were blocked into groups based on serum SDMA and creatinine concentrations, LBM, age, body weight, sex, USG and UPC. Each block of cats was randomly assigned to receive either control or test food.

However, mean values for these analytes were within the reference interval for all time points in cats fed both control and test foods; therefore, changes over time were not considered to be biologically relevant (data not shown). Mean concentrations for alkaline phosphatase at 6 months were decreased from baseline concentrations in cats fed control food (P&#x0003c;0.0001), for chloride were decreased from baseline in cats fed both control and test foods (P&#x0003c;0.0001) and for cholesterol were increased from baseline in cats fed test food (P&#x0003c;0.0001).

This was because urine creatinine concentration in cats consuming control food increased (P&#x0003c;0.0001) across time compared with baseline, whereas urine creatinine concentration of cats fed test food did not change compared with baseline (P=0.22).

The palatability of both control and test foods were very good; only one cat in each group was dismissed in the first 10 days of the study for poor food consumption. Thus, 93&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent of cats in each group successfully transitioned onto foods fed in this study. However, cats consuming control food had a significant loss of mean body weight (&#x02212;13.0&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent) during the 6-month feeding period, whereas cats consuming test food had a significant increase in mean body weight (5.8&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent). Cats consuming control food also had a significant reduction in mean BCS (&#x02212;0.5), whereas cats consuming test food had no change in BCS. In addition, cats consuming control food had a significant loss in LBM (&#x02212;11.1&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent) over the 6-month feeding period, whereas cats consuming test food had no change in LBM.</p><p>Both control and test food contained similar crude protein (6.65 and 6.69&#x02009;g/100 kcal, respectively) and phosphorus (1.18 and 1.05&#x02009;g/100 kcal, respectively) concentrations, but lower concentrations compared with industry averages.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Both renal foods met AAFCO recommendations for protein and essential amino acid concentrations in cat food. In addition, if food and caloric consumption were normal based on NRC estimates,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> both control and test foods should have provided adequate intake of essential amino acids. However, control cats did not consume enough food to maintain body weight and, therefore, also had reduced intake of all essential amino acids. Threonine was the most limiting amino acid in the control food (13&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent overage vs 50&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent overage in test food compared with AAFCO minimum recommended dietary threonine intake). Both foods had adequate threonine concentration when compared with AAFCO and NRC recommendations on an energy basis (minimums or adequate intakes, respectively). But, because there was reduced food intake in cats with renal disease, which was especially apparent in cats consuming control food, there was a greater need for amino acid fortification of foods. The greater dietary intake of essential amino acids in test food (a combination of increased consumption and higher concentration) resulted in all cats consuming test food having adequate intake of all amino acids, including threonine.</p><p>Consequently, the&#x000a0;authors hypothesised that insufficient consumption of essential amino acids was correlated with change in LBM noted in these CKD cats. The&#x000a0;authors found that consumption of the AAFCO recommended concentrations of threonine, or greater, resulted in maintenance of LBM, whereas there was a significant loss of LBM in cats that did not consume the recommended amounts of threonine (P&#x0003c;0.001). Furthermore, only threonine intake was positively correlated with change in LBM; both total protein and total energy intake were negatively correlated with change in LBM. These data suggest that it is beneficial to increase amino acid fortification (relative to AAFCO minimums) in foods designed for pets with compromised appetite, for&#x000a0;example, in early stages of CKD. Although threonine was the first limiting amino acid in this study, it is likely that inadequate intake of any of the essential amino acids would have resulted in loss of LBM.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Thus, adequate essential amino acid intake, not total dietary protein, was correlated with maintenance of LBM in CKD cats.</p><p>Food portions were determined by RER calculations for each cat. A similar number of calories were offered to cats fed control food (263 kcal/day) compared with cats fed test food (262 kcal/day) throughout the 6-month feeding period. However, cats voluntarily consumed 23&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent more calories when fed test food (mean, 207.1 kcal/day) compared with cats fed control food (mean, 168.0 kcal/day). A majority of cats fed control food did not consume sufficient calories to maintain body weight, as 11 of 14 cats lost &#x0003e;5 per cent of their baseline body weight. Weight loss among cats fed control food impacted their overall health. Four cats fed control food were dismissed for severe weight loss and BCS deterioration. Although cats fed test food also had substantial fluctuations in daily caloric intake, they still consumed sufficient calories to maintain body weight. In fact, 7 of 14 cats fed test food gained more than 5&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent of their baseline body weight such that mean body weight was significantly increased by the end of the study.</p><p>Cats with CKD often exhibit a reduced appetite, and their daily caloric intake may vary widely from day to day.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Weight loss is a common clinical finding in cats with CKD, and is often accompanied by loss of LBM and decreased BCS in more advanced stages of the disease<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> .<sup>520</sup>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Most of the cats enrolled in this study were in early stages of CKD (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>), such that finding a significant loss of LBM during the 6-month feeding study was unexpected. Therefore, it was surprising that cats fed control food on average lost 11.1&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent of LBM, whereas cats consuming test food had no loss of LBM.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for differences in mean body weights, BCS and LBM results between the two groups of cats. Test food may have had enhanced palatability compared with control food, thus increasing food intake. Test food was shown in a previous study to improve appetite in cats with CKD.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Test food also had 12&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent higher caloric density compared with control food. Test food contained higher concentrations of most essential amino acids (&#x0003e;140&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent of AAFCO minimum recommendations) compared with control food, which was limited in threonine because of decreased food intake. Lysine in the control food was the second most limiting amino acid (15&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent overage vs 74&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;cent overage in test food compared with the AAFCO minimum recommended dietary lysine). In addition, it is known that total lysine digestibility can be inaccurate when applied to commercially available cat foods.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Threonine and lysine play central hub and top controller roles, respectively, in the inter-relations between plasma amino acid concentrations and metabolism in essential amino&#x000a0;acid-deficient rats.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Test food also contained 100&#x000d7;&#x000a0;the&#x02009;concentration of L-carnitine present in control food. L-carnitine is responsible for facilitating transport of FA into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation and energy production.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In another study, adult cats consuming food supplemented with L-carnitine gained LBM over a 6-month feeding period compared with cats fed identical food without carnitine supplement (unpublished data). It is possible that any one or more of these test food attributes were responsible for differences in body weight changes when comparing control and treatment groups of cats. This study suggests that therapeutic renal foods with excellent palatability, increased caloric density and enhanced concentrations of essential amino acids and L-carnitine may help cats with CKD maintain body weight and LBM, particularly if they are finicky eaters or have fluctuating or poor appetites.</p><p>Regarding renal biomarkers, serum creatinine increased at a significantly faster rate in cats consuming control food compared with cats consuming test food. Simultaneously, urine creatinine concentrations increased in cats fed control food over the 6-month feeding period. Serum SDMA increased from baseline at a similar rate for both groups of cats; however, mean SDMA was below 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/dl at all time points. There was a trend for UPC to be lower in cats fed test food at 6 months compared with baseline (P=0.055), whereas USG remained stable in both groups of cats over the 6-month feeding period. Higher monthly serum and urine creatinine concentrations in cats fed control food compared with cats fed test food, may reflect catabolism of body tissues to meet energy requirements.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The goals of nutritional management of CKD are to meet the patient&#x02019;s nutrient and energy requirements, as well as to alleviate clinical signs and slow the progression of CKD. Restriction of dietary protein has been demonstrated to slow the rate of progression of renal damage in rats and people.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> However, the effect of protein restriction on the progression of renal damage in dogs and cats remains controversial and no definitive study exists on this matter.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 12 13</xref> At constant quality and digestibility, feeding more protein will result in more peptides and amino acids reaching the colon for fermentation by the colonic microbiota. Metabolites originating from bacterial fermentation of proteins in the large intestine appear to play a key role in the progression of CKD. Both serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate concentrations have been shown to negatively correlate with GFR in humans.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Indoxyl sulfate likely causes renal tubular damage through oxidative stress, promoting tubulointerstitial fibrosis, glomerular sclerosis and progression of CKD in rats.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>CKD is associated with malnutrition, inflammatory and oxidative stress, and cachexia.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Cachexia is a wasting syndrome associated with increased resting energy expenditure, weight loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue and loss of appetite. Although mechanisms are not completely understood, pro-inflammatory cytokines are thought to disturb the concentrations and activities of leptin (an anorexigenic peptide) and ghrelin (an orexigenic peptide), which act on hypothalamic neurons to decrease energy intake and increase energy expenditure. Both renal-support foods that were fed in this study contained high concentrations of long-chain (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). At sufficiently high dietary concentrations, these (n-3) PUFA have been shown to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines, ROS and the expression of adhesion molecules.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In conclusion, cats with CKD readily transition to renal food. The data suggest that renal foods with high concentrations of carnitine and essential amino acids, and of higher energy density, are critical for cats with IRIS stage 1 and 2 CKD to maintain body weight, BCS and LBM as these cats may have decreased appetite and fluctuations in daily food intake. Attributes of renal therapeutic foods considered important for managing major metabolic disorders associated with cachexia (increased resting energy requirements, decreased appetite and muscle atrophy) and for maintaining LBM are enhanced palatability, high caloric density, high concentrations of all essential amino acids, L-carnitine supplementation and added fish oil as a source of (n-3) highly PUFA. As in dogs,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> these results support the recommendation that feeding a renal-support diet to cats with IRIS stage 1 and 2 CKD should be considered the standard of care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The study was funded by and performed at the Pet Nutrition Center, Hill&#x02019;s Pet Nutrition, Topeka, Kansas, USA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hillspet.com/our-company.html">http://www.hillspet.com/our-company.html</ext-link>).
