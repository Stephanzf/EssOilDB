A total of 109 <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains were screened for lipid and carbohydrate production and the best results were found for the strains No. 6 and No. 32. The yields and productivities could reach up to 47.2 g/L and 0.72 g/L/h for lipid, 21.6 g/L and 0.33 g/L/h for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the strain No. 6, and 15.4 g/L and 0.18 g/L/h for carbohydrate in the strain No. 32, under the optimal conditions, respectively.

Moreover, aquatic animals and poultries also require DHA for their development and survival [<xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. is a kind of <italic>Thraustochytrids</italic>, which belong to a group of heterotrophic, unicellular, marine protists, and <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic>, <italic>Oblongichytrium</italic>, and <italic>Schizochytrium</italic> in <italic>Thraustochytrids</italic> are considered to form one genus [<xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a well-known oleaginous microorganism, <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. can accumulate a large amount of lipid, rich in DHA in its cell. Thus, <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. is a DHA producer and a substitute for the traditional fish oil resource as a new DHA resource [<xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, cells of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. are rich in valuable metabolites, such as terpenoids, pigment, carbohydrate, and protein, which have high nutritional values and multiple physiological functions. Thus, <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. has been widely applied in the medical, food, and feed industries [<xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>A large number of biochemical methods are essential for the analysis of the cellular compositions of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. in numerous types of researches, such as strain screening, medium optimization and fermentation monitoring for productions of the high-value metabolites. For examples, lipid content in the cell was analyzed through organic solvent extraction, evaporation and weighing [<xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Thus, there is a pressing need for developing reliable, environment-friendly and fast methods to analyze cellular composition in numerous researches for <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp.</p><p>FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) is molecular vibrational spectroscopy that dissects chemical functional groups in the mid-infrared zone between 4000 and 400 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The typical functional chemical groups in lipid, protein, and carbohydrate, such as C&#x02013;H stretching vibration acyl chains, ester C=O stretching band, C=O stretching vibration, N&#x02013;H bending vibration, C&#x02013;O and C&#x02013;O&#x02013;C stretching band, and so on, have characteristic absorbance in different frequency regions of the mid-infrared zone. Moreover, FT-IR can directly scan the cultured microalgal cells for cellular composition analysis without complex procedures and organic or inorganic reagents which are necessities in the traditional biochemical methods [<xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, FT-IR has been a rapid, green, high throughput and cost-effective tool for monitoring and analysis of the microalgal cellular composition [<xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Strains Screening</title><p>Screening <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains with high-level content of lipid or carbohydrate is the first and most essential step for achieving their significant industrial value. However, traditional biochemical analysis of lipid and carbohydrate need a long time, a large amount of cell culture and multi-instruments, leading to time and space limitations for screening. FT-IR is a high-throughput method for cellular biomolecular analysis, and needs a trace amount of cell culture, enabling it to be used for the rapid and high- throughput screening of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains.</p><p>Protein, carbohydrate, and lipid are three major bio-macromolecules of the cell and play different roles in the cell. Protein is closely related to basic biosynthesis and cell division, while lipids and carbohydrate serve as intracellular reservoirs of carbon and energy. Cells preferentially synthesize carbohydrate or lipid rather than protein for reserving carbon and energy to answer the poor growth condition. To screen <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains synthesizing high level of carbohydrate and lipid, the medium with nitrogen limitation condition, which might increase the carbohydrate and lipid synthesis and lead to a reduced synthesis of the protein [<xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], was used in this study. A total of 109 strains in our <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain library were analyzed by FT-IR. Based on the cellular contents of lipid, carbohydrate, and protein, a total of 18 strains were picked up among the 109 strains for further analysis after the 1st screening round (Data not shown). The FT-IR absorption profile for the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. Lipid was the bio-macromolecule with the highest content in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cell, followed by protein and carbohydrate in proper order, consistent with its oleaginous characteristic and similar to other <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain [<xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Absorption areas of representing peaks were used to quantify the contents of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B, the highest content of lipid was obtained in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6, while the lowest content of protein was obtained in this strain. The strain No. 32, with the highest content of carbohydrate, is a potential carbohydrate producer. Oppositely, the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 103 had the highest content of protein in its cell, with the lowest content of lipid and carbohydrate. These results indicated that the contents of carbohydrate and lipid, and the content of protein were negatively correlated in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cell. The traditional biochemical methods for analyzing lipid, carbohydrate, and protein in the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cells were applied to validate the accuracy of FT-IR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). To correct the effect of deuterated metabolic products on contents of three biomolecules in the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cells, the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 6 was cultured in the medium prepared with D<sub>2</sub>O for cell deuteration (D group). Meanwhile, the cells cultured in the medium prepared with H<sub>2</sub>O were set as the H group. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the FT-IR profiles of the D- and H-group cells were very similar. Further quantification analysis deduced by the FT-IR showed that the contents of three biomolecules, including lipid, protein and carbohydrate, were similar for the D- and H-group cells, suggesting that deuteration of cell or deuterated metabolic products distributed in a cell cannot affect the FT-IR results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). Biomass composition of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. varied greatly among the 18 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The lipid made up 35.9&#x02013;67.0% of DCW, the protein made up 8.0&#x02013;14.0% of DCW, and the carbohydrate made up 3.8&#x02013;8.4% of DCW. The FT-IR absorption area and the corresponding protein, carbohydrate and lipid content, were analyzed respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f003">Figure 3</xref>, good linear correlations among FT-IR absorption area versus protein (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9381), carbohydrate (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9226) and lipid (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9164) contents, respectively, were observed in 18 <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains. In this study, two normalization strategies, with amide I (1690&#x02013;1650 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, associated with biomass) and C&#x02013;H stretching region (3000&#x02013;2800 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, associated with lipid) as internal reference peaks for assessments of the relative contents of protein, lipid and carbohydrate, respectively, were applied to minimize the peak absorption&#x02019;s fluctuation caused by the inhomogeneous thickness of sample tablet [<xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, weak linear correlations were obtained through these two normalization methods, indicating that the two normalization methods are highly species-specific among microorganism strains, and not suitable for <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains (data not shown). As the Lambert-Beer&#x02019;s law described, the lipid or carbohydrate content (% DCW) is proportional to the corresponding FT-IR areas normalized by the amide I band (A<sub>lipid or carbohydrate</sub>/A<sub>amide I</sub>) only when the protein content keeps unchanged if the ratio of the molar absorptive coefficients of protein and lipid or carbohydrate is a constant [<xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This law is not suitable in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain due to the high variations of protein content in its cellular composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In the present study, we normalized the OD<sub>600</sub> of every cell sample to 0.1 and then analyzed its FT-IR profile. There were good linear correlations between lipid, carbohydrate and protein content (%DCW) and the corresponding FT-IR areas normalized by the OD<sub>600</sub> (A<sub>lipid, carbohydrate or protein</sub>/0.1 OD<sub>600</sub>), indicating that FT-IR analysis normalized by the OD<sub>600</sub> can be used to analyze cellular composition of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains. The same method was also applied to normalize the FT-IR peaks to analyze the lipid, carbohydrate and protein content in algae, yeast, and bacteria cell [<xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-24-01593"><title>2.2. Optimizations of Media for Lipid and Carbohydrate Productions</title><p><italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 had been screened for lipid and DHA productions; however, the media composition needed to be further optimized to obtain the optimal yields. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the optimal lipid content and DHA yield of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 6 were 73.6% DCW and 8 g/L when the concentrations of glucose, peptone and yeast extract were 120, 15 and 10 g/L, 35.1% and 25% higher than those in the initial condition. <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 could endure up to 120 g/L glucose, and did not exhibit the glucose inhibition until the concentration of glucose reached up to 140 g/L, which was higher than those of the other <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains, and characterized the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 as an ideal lipid and DHA producer needing less fed-batch times with lower potential pollution risk [<xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. C/N ratio in the medium is a key factor regulating lipid synthesis in oleaginous microorganisms, and the high C/N ratio condition (Nitrogen limitation) induces improvement of lipid production for carbon and energy reservations as an anti-stress response. Under nitrogen limitation condition, residual carbon source in medium flow to the lipid synthesis by producing acetoacetyl coenzyme A, which was the structural unit for lipid and DHA synthesis. However, a high C/N ratio is a disadvantage to cell growth and protein synthesis [<xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The optimal C/N ratio of the cultivation medium for lipid and DHA synthesis in strain 6 was up to 4.8 (glucose as carbon resource, peptone and yeast extract as nitrogen resource), which induced lipid and DHA synthesis significantly and had no obvious negative effect on cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Huang et al. found that a low C/N ratio (1.25) was optimal for <italic>Aurantiochytrium limacinum</italic> SR21 to produce lipid and DHA at a balance condition between biomass and lipid synthesis [<xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Results reported by Ryu et al. indicated that the highest DHA productivity (38.8% of total lipid) was observed in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. KRS101 when a C/N ratio in the medium was up to 20 [<xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These results validated that the C/N ratio in medium plays a significant role in regulating biomass, lipid and DHA productions in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp., and showed strain-specific among different strains. </p><p><italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 had been screened for the high carbohydrate content in its cells, and the medium composition was further optimized for carbohydrate production. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the highest carbohydrate content and yield (34.2% DCW, 7.56 g/L) were obtained under the optimal medium with 100 g/L glucose, 20 g/L peptone and 30 g/L yeast extract, 307% and 367% higher than those in the initial condition. As a heterotrophic marine protist, <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 could utilize up to 100 g/L of glucose to grow fast (22.1 g/L of biomass in 4 days) without glucose effect and inhibition, making it an ideal strain for industrial fermentation purposes. Meanwhile, the carbohydrate content and yield in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 cell could reach up to 34.2% of DCW and 7.56 g/L, which were higher than those in <italic>A. limacinum</italic> SR21 cell (33.38% DCW, 3.84 g/L) and those in <italic>Schizochytrium</italic> sp. HX-308 (13.58% DCW, 6.63 g/L) [<xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Under nutrient limitations, microbial cell preferentially synthesized carbohydrate and lipid for the carbon and energy reservation. However, accumulation of lipid was enhanced more quickly than that of carbohydrate in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. under different nutrient limitation conditions [<xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, a relatively low C/N ratio of 2 was the optimal value for balancing carbohydrate synthesis and biomass in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 to avoid over-accumulation of lipid, lower than that (4.8) of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain 6 for lipid production. Meanwhile, many micro-elements, such as metal elements and vitamins, were essential for <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains for cell growth and metabolite synthesis, increasing the production cost significantly [<xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Unlike the other strains, <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 did not need any micro-elements to obtain a high level of biomass and carbohydrate in its cell. This result indicates that the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 is an ideal potential candidate for producing carbohydrate. </p><p>Moreover, the FT-IR method was also used for lipid and carbohydrate contents analysis in optimization performances, and the results (% DCW) from the FT-IR method and the traditional biochemical method had high linear correlations with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.9006 for lipid analysis and 0.9575 for carbohydrate analysis, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The linear equations representing lipid and carbohydrate contents with the FT-IR method (x-axis) vs the traditional biochemical method (y-axis) were y = 1.5168x &#x02212; 26.143 for lipid and y = 1.0231x &#x02212; 0.1715 for carbohydrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The area of the 1740 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in FT-IR, representing the ester C=O stretching band, was used to quantify the lipid content in <italic>Thraustochytrium</italic> sp. cells [<xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Meanwhile, the 3000&#x02013;2800 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> area of FT-IR, representing the C&#x02013;H stretching vibration acyl chains, was also used to analyze the lipid contents in marine microalgae with the amino I area (1650 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as the internal standard. However, this range of area in FT-IR could not be used to quantify the lipid content in some microalgae due to its high variability in this area of FT-IR caused by the overlapping of OH bond absorption and therefore leading to misinterpretations [<xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, these two areas in FT-IR, representing two important chemical bonds in lipid, were firstly considered in combination for lipid analysis in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cells due to its high lipid content and relative stable profile in the 3000&#x02013;2800 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of FT-IR, and a high accuracy for lipid analysis (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9006) was obtained through this analysis method. However, these results above were obtained at an approximate lipid content range of 45&#x02013;73% DCW, cells with the lipid content under 26% DCW might not be analyzed by this FT-IR method. This result indicated that the FT-IR method for lipid analysis used in this study is specific for the oleaginous microorganism, such as <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. (with higher lipid content, up to 70% in cells), while not fit for the microorganisms with low lipid content. </p><p>For carbohydrate analysis, absorption signals around 1180&#x02013;1133 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in FT-IR characterized over a C&#x02013;O, and the C&#x02013;O&#x02013;C stretching band area was used to quantify the total carbohydrate content in the cell. The C&#x02013;O and C&#x02013;O&#x02013;C stretching bands were the typical bonds in carbohydrate, and a high coefficient of determination (0.9575) was obtained through this method, indicating that the 1200&#x02013;900 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in FT-IR response accurately to the carbohydrate content in the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cells. Absorption area of around the 1200&#x02013;900 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> band in FT-IR was also used to analyze carbohydrate content in <italic>Chlorella pyrenoedosa</italic>, <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> sp., <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> and <italic>Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> [<xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-24-01593"><title>2.3. Assessments of the FT-IR and Traditional Methods</title><p>Assessments of the FT-IR and traditional methods for analysis of bio-macromolecule were summarized in <xref rid="molecules-24-01593-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. At least 1 g of the dried cell is needed for analysis using the traditional biochemical method; thus, at least 50 mL of liquid sample was cultured and lyophilized. The time consumption of this method for analysis is at least 72 h, including cell lyophilization and grinding, lipid extraction and weighing, carbohydrate extraction, reaction with sulfuric acid and anthrone, and analysis of carbohydrate content. A large number of reagents, such as liquid nitrogen, chloroform, methanol, sulfuric acid, and anthrone, which have severe corrosivity, irritation, and pollution, have to be used in the traditional biochemical method. Moreover, numerous pieces of equipment, such as the centrifuge, freeze dryer, mortar, pestle, evaporimeter, and balance, are also essential for the traditional method. Thus, the traditional biochemical method for bio-macromolecules is time-consuming, expensive, equipment-limited and severely polluted. The 96 well microplates are used for analysis in FT-IR. Therefore, only approximately 200 &#x003bc;L of the liquid sample is needed for every sample analysis through FT-IR. Without cell lyophilization, bio-macromolecule extraction and analysis, only approximate 4 h is required for FT-IR analysis, saving approximate 17 times than that of the traditional biochemical method. Moreover, due to the simple process, only the FT-IR spectrometer and spectrophotometer are needed in FT-IR, and no chemical reagent is required for analysis. Unlike the traditional biochemical methods, which can detect only one kind of bio-macromolecule at a time, the FT-IR can simultaneously detect the content of lipid, carbohydrate and protein components. However, the overlap of the stretching vibration peaks of different biochemical components made FT-IR analysis a certain degree of quantity inaccuracy. In this study, various combinations of peaks-integration and normalization were analyzed and compared with the results from the traditional biochemical methods, and high coefficients of determination (R = 0.9006 for lipid and R = 0.9575 for carbohydrate) were obtained. Thus, FT-IR analysis is a very economical and green method with less pollution and high accuracy for bio-macromolecule analysis in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. cell.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-24-01593"><title>2.4. FT-IR for Monitoring Fermentative Parameters during Lipid and Carbohydrate Productions</title><p>Based on the optimized media for the <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains No. 6 and No. 32, respectively, 5 L fermentations were performed for lipid and carbohydrate productions under the FT-IR monitoring. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, a total of 119.1 g/L reducing sugar was consumed, and a maximum DCW of up to 66.4 g/L was obtained in 60 h. The cell of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains No. 6 entered the stable stage of growth at 54 h and was kept until the end of fermentation at 72 h. At the later period of fermentation, the maximum lipid content and DHA yield, up to 72.4% DCW and 21.6 g/L, respectively, were obtained at 66 h, suggesting that the carbon resource was first consumed for cell growth of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains No. 6, and then for lipid synthesis when the carbon resource was consumed to deficiency. The DCW, lipid and DHA productivities of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 6 could reach up to 1.11 g/L/h, 0.72 g/L/h and 0.33 g/L/h, respectively, higher than those of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strains YLH70, SR21, and <italic>Japonochytrium marinum</italic> AN-4 [<xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As an essential fermentative parameter of oleaginous <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp., lipid content was monitored through FT-IR method synchronously, guiding for lipid and DHA production of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. with high speed and accuracy. </p><p>FT-IR method was also used for carbohydrate analysis during the fermentation by <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01593-f006">Figure 6</xref>B, a total of 99.9 g/L of reducing sugar was consumed during the fermentation process (96 h), with a consumption rate of up to 1.04 g/L/h, indicating an ideal fermentative characteristic of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 without apparent glucose inhibition effect. The cell of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 reached the stable stage of growth at approximate 78 h, and the maximum biomass of 49.1 g/L was obtained at 84 h. The biomass productivity for <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 was 0.58 g/L/h. Meanwhile, a maximum carbohydrate production of 31.3% DCW, reaching up to 15.4 g/L, was obtained at 84 h with carbohydrate productivity of up to 0.18 g/L/h. It was found that the carbohydrate content in the cell of <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 begun to be improved when the concentration of reducing sugar dropped to approximate 20 g/L and reached the highest level during the stable stage of the cell growth. This result suggested that the reducing sugar was first inflowed into the metabolic pathway for cell growth, and then into the carbohydrate synthesis for energy reservation when the reducing sugar was consumed to deficiency. Moreover, although microbial cell preferentially synthesizes lipid and carbohydrate under the nutrition conditions, lipid was accumulated more rapidly than carbohydrate. This finding could explain why the emergence of the maximum carbohydrate content in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 32 (at 66 h) was later than that of the maximum lipid content in <italic>Aurantiochytrium</italic> sp. strain No. 6 (at 84 h), and carbohydrate fermentation needed more time for higher productivity [<xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01593" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
