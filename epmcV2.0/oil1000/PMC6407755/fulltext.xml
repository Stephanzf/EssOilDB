Our purpose was to investigate the physicochemical properties, micronutrients and oxidative stability of the oil extracted from the five varieties of rapeseeds during their different stages of refining process. Increase in the acid value, peroxide value and <italic>p</italic>-anisidine value were detected in the refining, while content of tocopherols, sterols, &#x003b2;-carotene and phenols, which are regarded as important nutritional compounds diminished. Moreover, the loss rate of total phytosterols of all oils during neutralization (9.23&#x02013;7.3%) and deodorization (9.97&#x02013;8.27%) were higher than that of degumming (3.01&#x02013;0.87%) and bleaching (2.75&#x02013;1.18%). Deodorization affected total tocopherols contents the most, followed by bleaching, neutralization and degumming. There was a remarkable reduction in total content of phenol, &#x003b2;-carotene and oxygen radical absorbance of all oils during refining. The accumulated information can be used in looking for the optimum condition to meet the basic requirements for oil and minimize micronutrients losses so as to increase their market value.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Special National Key Research and Development Plan</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0400206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ju</surname><given-names>Xingrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Postgraduate Research &#x00026;Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>KYCX17-1225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions</institution></funding-source><award-id>PAPD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors acknowledge the financial support for this study from the Special National Key Research and Development Plan (2016YFD0400206), Postgraduate Research &#x00026;Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX17-1225) and a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rapeseed oil is a major source of vegetable oil in the world. Its production is estimated at 27.71 million metric tons, the third just behind palm and soybean oil, supporting the 2018 official data of United States Department of Agriculture. Rapeseed oil contains around 1.5&#x02013;6% palmitic acid, around 0.5&#x02013;3.1% stearic acid, around 28% oleic acid, around 11&#x02013;23% linoleic acid, and around 5&#x02013;13% linolenic acid. It is characterized by the ideal content of polyunsaturated fatty acid due to the ratio (2:1) of linoleic acid (n-6) and linolenic acid (n-3) fatty acid. On the other hand, the rapeseed oil contains many active biological compounds such as phytosterols, tocopherol, phenolic compounds, &#x003b2;-carotene [<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Quality and stability are the main factors in the oil production which decide acceptance and sales of vegetable oil products [<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the fatty acid composition and minor components such as free fatty acids, phospholipids, trace metals, color pigments, phenolic compounds and waxes of vegetable oil products often affect quality and stability [<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Phosphatides, free fatty acids, odiferous volatiles, colourant, waxes and metal compounds, which are undesirable materials in crude rapeseed oil products, have adverse effects on physicochemical properties, sensory characteristics, and storage stability of the rapeseed oil. Towards this, the crude rapeseed oil needs refining treatments to remove undesirable ingredients and produce higher quality oils [<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Traditional rapeseed oil refining processes generally involve four successive operations: neutralization, degumming, bleaching and deodorization. Although the traditional chemical refining processes are useful to remove the majority of these unwanted components and could achieve the desired color and a mild taste, micronutrients such as tocopherol, phytosterols, &#x003b2;-carotene and phenolic compounds will have at somewhat loss during the refining process, and antioxidant activity of oil will change as well. Moreover the oxidation of lipid and its associated substances, lipid degradation products, toxic and harmful substances will exist in the oil products during the refining process and then affect the quality and function of products [<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In the last decades, many researchers have focused on the evaluation of influence of different compositional parameters on quality and stability of vegetable oils. For instance, Klara Kraljic&#x000b4; explored changes in phenolic compounds during specific refining process of rapeseed oil [<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Aleksandra Szyd&#x00142;owska-Czerniak studied the relation between loss of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity in the refining process of palm oil [<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Jia Wei optimized refining method for the most suitable temperatures to retain several essential fatty acids and bioactive compounds in the tea seed oil [<xref rid="pone.0212879.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although many researchers have investigated the physicochemical properties of rapeseed oil, there is still a lack of information on the physicochemical properties and oxidative stability as it relates to different rapeseed varieties during refining process.</p><p>The need for a more comprehensive study for the physicochemical properties and oxidative stability of rapeseed varieties available in the marketplace is crucial. Thus, the first objective of this work was to investigate the physicochemical properties of five different kinds of rapeseed oils during different stages of traditional refining process; secondly, the study aims to broaden knowledge and provide helpful data for the future optimization of the traditional oil refining process without affecting the desirable compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Materials</title><p>Tocopherol standards (&#x003b1;-tocopherol, &#x003b2;-tocopherol, &#x003b3;-tocopherol and &#x003b4;-tocopherol, purity&#x0003e;98%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical (Nanjing, China).

Furthermore, the high deodorized temperature (250&#x000b0;C and 270&#x000b0;C) induced the percentage content of trans fatty acid increased much higher than that of low deodorization temperature (190&#x000b0;C, 210&#x000b0;C and 230&#x000b0;C) which indicated that isomerization of double bonds can be promoted under high temperature.</p><fig id="pone.0212879.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0212879.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Trans-linoleic and trans-linolenic percentage contents of oils of number 1 (A), number 2 (B), number 3 (C), number 4 (D), number 5 (E) at different deodorized temperature including 190&#x000b0;C, 210&#x000b0;C, 230&#x000b0;C, 250&#x000b0;C and 270&#x000b0;C.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0212879.g007"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Considering comprehensively, the neutralization stage and the deodorization stage have the greatest influence on the micronutrients and antioxidant activity of rapeseed oil, followed by the bleaching stage, and the least affected is the degumming stage. A similar trend was observed for the AV, PV and <italic>p</italic>-AV changes of the oils in varieties during refining process, which indicates that there was no significant difference between these chemical properties of rapeseed oil in varieties. Content of phytosterols, tocopherols, TPC, &#x003b2;-carotene and ORAC did not show clear trends for any of the different rapeseed oil varieties, either. This study provides a scientific basis for the necessity of moderate refining of rapeseed oil in actual industrial production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212879.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Acid value of five different kinds of rapeseed oils during the refining process (mgKOH/g).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212879.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212879.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Peroxide value of five different kinds of rapeseed oils during the refining process (mmol/kg oil).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212879.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212879.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>p-Anisidine value of five different kinds of rapeseed oils during the refining process.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212879.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212879.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>The content of Phytosterols in five different kinds of rapeseed oil (&#x003bc;g/g oil).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212879.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212879.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>The contents of tocopherols in five different kinds of oil (&#x003bc;g/g oil).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212879.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212879.s006"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>TPC of five different kinds of rapeseed oils (mg GAE/100g oil).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212879.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212879.s007"><label>S7 Table</label><caption><title>The content of &#x003b2;-carotene in five different kinds of rapeseed oil (mg/ 100g oil).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212879.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212879.s008"><label>S8 Table</label><caption><title>The ORAC in five different kinds of rapeseed oil (&#x003bc;mol TE / 100g oil).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212879.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the financial support for this study from the Special National Key Research and Development Plan (2016YFD0400206), Postgraduate Research &#x00026;Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX17-1225) and a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0212879.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Siger</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gawrysiak-Witulska</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bartkowiak-Broda</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>. <article-title>Antioxidant (tocopherol and canolol) content in rapeseed oil obtained from roasted yellow-seeded brassica napus</article-title>. <source>Journal of the American Oil Chemists&#x02019; Society</source>. <year>2017</year>;<volume>94</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>37</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>46</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s11746-016-2921-7</pub-id>
