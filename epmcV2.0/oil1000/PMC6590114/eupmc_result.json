    "BACKGROUND:Interest in supplementing food with iron to counteract dietary deficiencies has been on the rise in recent years. A major challenge is the pro-oxidant activity of soluble iron, which compromises the chemical stability of the enriched food products. This problem could be mitigated by encapsulating iron, to physically keep it separated from oxidizable substrates, such as unsaturated fatty acids. In the present work, the physical and chemical stability of surfactant- or protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions fortified with iron was investigated. RESULTS:Iron (ferrous sulfate) was successfully incorporated in liposomes at high encapsulation efficiency (89%). The liposomes obtained were added to emulsions stabilized with either Tween 20 or whey protein isolate (WPI), and its oxidative stability was monitored and compared with emulsions with free iron. Tween 20-stabilized emulsions were more stable against oxidation than WPI-stabilized emulsions, and furthermore lipid oxidation was substantially higher in emulsions containing iron (either free, or encapsulated in liposomes) than in blank emulsions. This shows that liposomal encapsulation did not inhibit the pro-oxidant activity of iron. CONCLUSION:Despite the high encapsulation efficiency of iron in our liposomes, these systems are not suitable to supplement model foods with iron because of the associated deleterious chemical reactivity. This is most probably due to the phospholipids used as encapsulation material being prone to oxidation, which may actively contribute to the oxidative process. These aspects are normally not taken into account but we showed that they are of utmost importance, and should be taken as a starting point in the design of delivery systems. © 2018 The Authors.
