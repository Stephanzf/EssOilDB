    "Bioinspired designs of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials have been an important and fascinating area of research in recent years for their extensive potential application prospects from industry to our daily life. Despite extensive progress, existing research achievements are far from real applications. From biomimetic performance to service life, the related research has faced serious problems at present. A timely outlook is therefore necessary to summarize the existing research, to discuss the challenges faced, and to propose constructive advice for the ongoing scientific trend. Here, we comb the process of development of bioinspired superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials at first. Then, we also describe how to design artificial superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials. Furthermore, current challenges faced by bioinspired designs of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials are pointed out, separately, and the possible solutions are discussed. Emerging applications in this field are also briefly considered. Finally, the development trend within this field is highlighted to lead future research."
