    "This study compared the effect of two vegetable oils and their feeding duration on pig backfat quality. The experiment was conducted with 60 DanBred pigs that were fed a diet supplemented (40 g/kg) with rapeseed or soybean oil for 2, 4 or 6 weeks before slaughter at 152 d of age. The supplementation of both vegetable oils in the diets for 6 weeks negatively changed backfat consistency. The pigs fed soybean oil for 4 (17.64%) and 6 weeks (18.52%) before slaughter showed an increase in backfat linoleic acid content (p = 0.002), whereas, in contrast to the other groups, rapeseed oil in the diet for 6 weeks (2.38%) increased α-linolenic acid content (p = 0.039). The content of PUFAs (p = 0.024) and n-6 PUFAs (p = 0.003) was increased by adding soybean oil to the diet for 4 and 6 weeks. The ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs was decreased (p = 0.040) by supplementing rapeseed oil for 4 and 6 weeks. The oil feeding duration decreased (p < 0.001) the atherogenic and thrombogenic indices. The lipid oxidative stability of backfat stored for 3 and 5 days increased (p < 0.001) in pigs fed dietary vegetable oils for 6 weeks prior to slaughter. In conclusion, the feeding of rapeseed oil for 4 weeks before slaughter is sufficient for improving the FA profile without negative effect on the consistency of the backfat."
