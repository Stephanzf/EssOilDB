    "The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant effects of the essential oils of Myrtus communis leaves and Thymus caramanicus aerial parts in order to improve the physicochemical properties of potato chips. Sunflower oil without any antioxidant (control group) was fortified with BHA or TBHQ antioxidants (200 ppm), and M. communis or T. caramanicus essential oils (3,000 ppm). The effects of the antioxidant behavior of these compounds on the physicochemical properties of potato chips were analyzed by measuring peroxide value (PV), acid value (AV), and thiobarbituric acid (TBA). In addition, changes occurring in oxidation stability, texture, and color were evaluated. The results revealed that samples containing either M. communis or T. carmanicus showed a significant decrease in PV, as compared to the control sample. Compared with the control, the extracted oil of potato chips with M. communis or T. carmanicus led to the significant reduction in AV (p < .05). The results also revealed the addition of the essential oils of M. communis or T. carmanicus was obviously effective in preventing the TBA increasing value. Based on the results obtained by the Rancimat test, either T. carmanicus or M. communis essential oils could significantly increase the shelf-life of potato chips, as compared with the control sample (p < .05). The hardness of potato chips was decreased in M. communis or T. carmanicus groups (p < .05), as compared to the control sample. Neither M. communis nor T. carmanicus essential oils had any negative effects on the lightness values, as compared to the control (p > .05). Based on the results, the physicochemical properties of potato chips could be improved with the addition of these essential oils."
