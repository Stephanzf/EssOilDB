    "This study examined the status of toxic metal contamination of the urban industrial city of Ahvaz in Iran. Two hundred and twenty-seven surface soils from a depth horizon of 0-10 cm were collected from urban areas. In addition, 15 soil samples were collected to recognise the sources of Pb in urban topsoils in Ahvaz city. Mean concentration of Pb, Zn, Cu and As were 181 ± 167, 123 ± 118, 185 ± 167 and 6.9 ± 8.9 mg.kg-1, respectively. Results of inter-element relationship among studied toxic metals revealed that Pb, Zn and Cu may have the same anthropogenic origin, whilst As originated from different sources. The results of pollution index (PI) and Nemerow pollution index (NPI) implied that Pb, Zn, and Cu had a moderate to high level of pollution. The Pb isotopic composition analysis suggested clear anthropogenic origins of Pb including industrial emission, vehicle exhaust and dust storm with the mean contributions of 47%, 15% and 7%, respectively, by a four-end member model."
