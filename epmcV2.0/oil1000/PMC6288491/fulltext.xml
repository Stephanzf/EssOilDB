The identification of the emitted gases is essential to determine their contribution to the depletion of the ozone layer and is measured in Kg. Eq. CFC-11 with LCA software, SimaPro. The criterion used in this evaluation are based on a life cycle analysis methodology and the objectives, scope and limitations of the productive system were defined based on this. From this information an inventory was made, taking as the main element the quantitative measurement of matter and energy flows for all inputs and outputs of the production process. The information about the process enabled the identification, characterization and assessment of the environmental impact of global warming related to the production of plastic bags, leading to the conclusion that the most polluting process is that of extrusion followed by the printing of plastic bags.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keyword</title><kwd>Environmental science</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The ozone layer is a band of natural gas called &#x0201c;ozone&#x0201d;. It is found between 9.3 and 18.6 miles (15&#x02013;30 kilometers) above the Earth in what is known as the stratosphere, and it functions as a shield against harmful ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation emitted by the sun. At present there is a general concern that the ozone layer is being depleted by the release of pollutants contained in chemical products. The release of these contaminants upsets the delicate balance in the natural production and decomposition of ozone molecules by eliminating the molecules faster than they can be replenished <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">The most detrimental compounds to the ozone layer are chlorofluorocarbons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, halons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFC) and methyl bromide <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The degree of damage caused by any one of these substances to the ozone layer depends on the chemical properties of the compound. Other factors that affect the ozone layer include climate change and greenhouse gasses such as methane and nitrous oxide.</p><p id="p0020">Plastic bags are produced from one of three basic polymers: polyethylene, high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), or linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). Supermarket plastic bags are usually made from HDPE. Plastics are not in and of themselves toxic or harmful. However, plastic bags are manufactured using organic and inorganic additives such as colorants and pigments, plasticizers, antioxidants, stabilizers and metals <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">The heavy metals of cadmium and lead contained in the pigments used in the manufacture of plastic bags, and the antioxidants and stabilizers, are inorganic and organic chemicals that serve to protect the plastic against thermal decomposition during the manufacturing process. These industrial chemicals are thought to be a great source of atmospheric pollution since they are able to bond with other elements and form compounds such as chlorides, oxides, and sulfides <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, all of which contribute to a considerable degree towards ozone destruction based on their varying proportions and depending on a range of factors <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">In addition, the authors of a study carried out by the University of Hawaii <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> recently reported that as plastics decompose they emit methane and ethylene. Polyethylene is the most widely produced and discarded synthetic polymer at a global level (it is used in shopping bags). It is also the one that most prolifically emits methane and ethylene.</p><p id="p0035">Although the major effects of plastic bag manufacture points towards global warming, &#x0201c;The damage goes both ways: global warming alters the ozone layer and the depletion of the ozone layer feeds global warming&#x0201d; according to the Ozone Secretary of the Environmental Program of the United Nations <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A study published in the journal Nature Geoscience <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> shows that the warming of the Earth affects the flow of existing ozone between the stratosphere and the troposphere. The accumulation of greenhouse gasses causes the stratospheric ozone to travel from the stratosphere to the troposphere thus leading to the destruction of the ozone layer and greater air pollution. When stratospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is found lower than 15 kilometers it is considered to be a pollutant. By the same token, some of the compounds that destroy ozone are also potent greenhouse gasses <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="p0040">The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the manufacture of plastic shopping bags for mass consumption in a supermarket chain and locate them in the category of ozone layer depletion. Depletion is evaluated in the &#x0201c;environmental impact&#x0201d; category &#x0201c;ozone layer depletion&#x0201d;. This evaluation is based on life cycle analysis methodology (LCA), which starts by defining the inputs and outputs of each stage of the process, using each of the production records of the company for the years 2014 and 2015. Mass and energy levels were determined to establish the production flows. Based on this information, the scope and objectives of this study were defined including the inventory analysis and the environmental impact assessment for the manufacturing process of plastic bags. The inventory analysis allowed for identifying, selecting and characterizing the environmental loads of production processes. Based on the aforementioned steps, it was determined which stages of the manufacturing process generate the greatest environmental impact.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><p id="p0045">Our aim was to use a methodology that can be easily understood by industry while also fulfilling university research standards. As such, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) in line with the ISO 14040 (2007) <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> standards was used for the research. Four general steps were followed: defining the objectives and scope, inventory analysis, environmental impact analysis of the product, and interpretation <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Phase 1: Definition of the scope and objectives</title><p id="p0050">As mentioned above, this research describes the comparative analysis of the ozone layer depletion due to a massive consumption of plastics bags in a chain of stores serving an area of one and a half million inhabitants. The unit of analysis is the production process of 14-inch plastic bags. Each of the production logs kept by the manufacturer during 2014 and 2015 were examined. The system boundaries covered printing, extrusion, sealing and recovery, and these were used to define door-to-door life cycle analysis encompassing the entry of raw materials up until arriving at a final product.</p><p id="p0055">The analysis of emissions and environmental loads was excluded for the following stages: extraction of raw materials, transport, plastic bag use by the clients and final disposal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Phase 2: Life cycle inventory analysis</title><p id="p0060">The Life Cycle Inventory phase was developed by analyzing the collected data and performing data calculation of both a qualitative and quantitative nature.</p><p id="p0065">Primary data related to the production of plastic bags was gleaned from a manufacturing company located in the city of Bucaramanga, Colombia.

Other aspects that were considered include voltage, amperage and the efficiency of each motor.</p><p id="p0080">Water consumption during the extrusion phase was not considered since it does not influence the product in any physical way. It is only used to cool the extrusion machinery. Water leaves and enters the system in a continuous cycle from the water store to the machine and back again, thus maintaining the same amount of water constantly.</p><p id="p0085">The software Sima Pro (version 7.1) <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> was used for the calculations.

Color is added to the material at this stage, as well as the desirable characteristics and properties such as the size of the roll, texture and nature (bio or non-biodegradable) of the bag, among others.</p><p id="p0155">The second process, called imprinting, only applies to plastic bags that require it. At this stage a flexographic machine is used allowing for printing directly from the extrusion stage. While the process may seem simple at first glance, it is very complicated since it requires more precision and monitoring by the operator. Small variations in the amount of ink, drying time or speed may lead to undesirable printing results.</p><p id="p0160">The film printing is followed by a sealing step, wherein bags are first cut according to the size, type of bag and pleat size, and other characteristics before sealing the bag seams. Plastic bags are the final product of this stage, which are then sent to storage and later delivered to the customer. In addition, any excess material is sent to the recovery sub-process where it is bonded and pelletized to be used for manufacturing other types of bags <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Environmental impact assessment</title><p id="p0165">For the environmental impact assessment of the ozone layer depletion category, some of the substances emitted in the manufacturing process were considered, and then identified and classified according to the inventory analysis obtained in this study.</p><p id="p0170">The next step of this methodology includes the characterization and the environmental profile of each stage's contribution to the impact categories associated with the process.<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0025"><list-item id="u0025"><label>-</label><p id="p0175">Identification, selection and characterization of environmental impact categories.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0180">The pollutant emissions identified in the different stages of the process by way of the inventory analysis were considered as they relate to the selection of the environmental impact category: ozone layer depletion. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> shows the identification and selection of all categories to be analyzed for the characterization and impact assessment according to the environmental action of the process.

In general, the output of the extrusion process is the largest contributor, close to 50%, in all the categories because this is where oil-derived raw materials enter the manufacturing process for compounds such as HDPE and linear polyethylene, representing a high rate of contamination. High energy consumption and low efficiency in engines is also recorded at this stage [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0190">Secondly, the 2nd film obtained in the printing process accounts for 30% of the impact in each category. This high percentage is due to the use of materials such as alcohol, inks and ethyl. Furthermore, in this process engines work to the lowest possible efficiency, resulting in higher energy consumption. As depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>, the cutting and sealing process contributes the least, with a value close to 4%, since raw materials are not required in this stage, only the product in process. This machine is also the most efficient. Finally, the black pelletized represents 2,5%, higher than the general pelletized (2%), because the latter does not contain added substances such as inks.</p><p id="p0195">As mentioned above, the highest contributors to the &#x0201c;ozone layer depletion&#x0201d; category are the film 1, film 2, cutting and sealing while the contribution of general and waste pelletization is lower. This can be explained by the fact that some oil-delivered materials such as crude oil, gasoline and naphtha are used in the extrusion and printing processes, with a very strong and negative impact on the ozone layer, in addition to those processes that lead to extrusion and transformation <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0200">Using Life Cycle Analysis methodology and Sima Pro 7.1, the potential environmental impact of the ozone layer depletion has been assessed and thus it has been determined which stages of the process contribute to the environmental impact of the categories selected in this study.
