The reported symptoms describe acute toxic reactions that differ completely from the known side effects and tissue changes during long-term ophthalmological perfluorooctane (PFO) use.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Serious toxic complications reported in 2015 after the intraocular use of PFO-batches produced by the Alamedics company (Dornstadt, Germany) were investigated and documented intensively.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Previous work has shown that the toxic complications are due to reactive underfluorinated impurities,<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> proven by determining the H-value, which quantifies such impurities and can be used as safety measure. The H-value is a quality parameter for fluorinated compounds in which, ideally, all hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms (PFCL). It indicates the concentration of the defective remaining hydrogen atoms. Its determination is carried out in two steps. Hydrogene fluoride (HF) is split off by a chemical transformation targeting precisely the residual protons. This is quantified potentiometrically in a subsequent analysis step. It should be performed as a limit test. The acceptance criterion should be &#x0201c;practically free from,&#x0201d; that means less than or equal to the detection limit (10 ppm).</p><p>The H-value was originally developed as a quality criterion for PFCL as blood substitutes<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and was later also applied to ophthalmological application.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Its clinical relevance has recently been demonstrated as a safety parameter for PFO/PFCL endotamponades.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The retinal toxicity of hydrogen-containing PFCLs was reported by Sparrow at al.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and Chang et al.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> independent of the use of the H-value to characterize underfluorinated impurities. The given limit of 0.1 ppm was adopted to provide information on the raw material's manufacturer without disclosing their tests and validation. Their demand of the use of products with the highest possible quality is equivalent to the fixing of the acceptance criterion to the detection limit of suitable and validated procedures.</p><p>The H-value limit of 10 ppm was exceeded by several orders of magnitude in the PFO batches concerned. Individual batch differences in the H-value and associated cell growth inhibition were also striking.</p><p>The H-value used as the limit value of a sum parameter does not allow any conclusions about the specific identity of impurities.

However, the relation between OH content and the leachables' content to the cytotoxicity observed in vitro remained vague. Due to large differences in the type and concentration of impurities in the affected batches, the need arose for a detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment of all impurities in order to provide a scientifically sound basis for general specifications. Also note that the impurities are dissolved in PFO and must first pass the interface to the tissue to be able to penetrate and interact with the ocular tissue and thus develop their toxic effect. Therefore, the purpose of our investigations focused on analyzing exactly those Alamedics PFO-batches (Ala<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>octa) involved in the reported cases and available in their original condition. Our analyses were carried out in three steps: (1) characterization of impurities using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (GC/MS); (2) verification of the degradation of reactive underfluorinated impurities by testing HF content; and (3) extraction experiments to test in vivo the effect of conditions favoring tissue penetration on PFO impurity profiles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Material</title><p>Our investigations were performed on the original packaged samples of Ala<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>octa batches manufactured by Alamedics (listed in <xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="i2164-2591-8-3-24-t01" content-type="1col" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Original Packaged Lots of Ala<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>octa, Manufactured by Alamedics GmbH&#x00026;Co KG (Dornstadt, Germany) From Which Test Samples Were Collected</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup span="1"><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char="" span="1"/><col id="tb1col2" align="center" charoff="0" char="" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ala<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>octa Lot #<hr/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expiry Date<hr/></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">171214</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2018-12</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">061014</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2018-10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">050514</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2018-05</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">080714</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2018-07</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">150414</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2018-04</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">200114</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2018-01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">070714</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2018-07</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">041213</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2017-12</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Presented tests in this paper were completed before the expiry date was reached.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We also tested the batches' raw materials: raw material R 1 = batch 1205052; raw material R2 = batch 1225572; R2/2 means: container 2 of raw material 2.</p><p>A commercial PFO, batch (PFO 33/15), with an H value &#x0003c; 10 ppm, manufactured and highly purified by Pharmpur GmbH (Koenigsbrunn, Germany), served as reference material.</p><p>Purified water according to Ph.

Surface-Active Contaminants</title><p>In addition to the compound groups contributing to overall toxicity, impurities with surface-modifying properties are a further risk factor.</p><p>They may belong to both the group of reactive underfluorinated compounds and the group of nonreactive underfluorinated compounds. An essential characteristic of this impurity group is its amphiphilic character, that is, the impurities interact with media of different polarity and hydrophilicity/lipophilicity. The surface activity may vary from surface-modifying action (1-H-perfluoroalkanes) to real surfactant behaviors (derivatives of perfluoroalkanoic acids).</p><p>The perfluoroalkanoic acid derivatives, including the acids themselves, play a special role. On the one hand, their effect as a strong surface-modifying substance must be taken into account and assigned accordingly to this group of impurities. On the other hand, they have a perfluorinated molecule part that can contain incompletely fluorinated positions in the fluorine chain due to the production process. Therefore, corresponding impurities must also be classified in the group of reactive, incompletely fluorinated impurities, and the reactions described above involving HF formation must be expected. In addition, in the case of free acids, the immediate corrosive action of the acid group must be taken into account. In contrast to HF, these acids must be classified as strong acids. The undesirable side effects of this class of substances are that they lower the interfacial tension against water, leading to an associated increase in interaction with tissue and enhanced penetration of lipophilic molecules; they also function as an adhesion promoter by interaction between the silicone oil and retinal surface (stickiness) during a subsequent silicone oil tamponade.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b17" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>While 1-H-perfluoroalkanes can form during synthesis of the raw material, the derivatives of perfluoroalkanoic acids are residues of unreacted starting compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4a4"><title>4. Fully Fluorinated By-Products</title><p>For the sake of completeness, the fully fluorinated by-products of PFO production should also be mentioned; their chemical structure is so closely related to PFO and their properties so similar that they are difficult to separate from one another.

This is particularly relevant for their toxic potential. The reactive underfluorinated compounds (1) cause acute cytotoxic reactions due to their own toxic effect (especially when they contain double bonds) and the formation of HF already in the ppm range. An additional particular hazard potential lies in the fact that they can show both immediate and delayed (latent, depot) effects, depending on their reactivity.</p><p>Surface-active contaminants (3) are able to alter the barrier function of cell membranes and lead to long-term damage. They contribute only indirectly to acute toxicity by intensifying the interaction with other noxae.

This can only be explained by an additional effect.</p><p>However, since no significant difference was reported in the course and extent of the damage in different batches, the triggering noxious agent must have an immediate effect at lowest concentrations.

It should be emphasized that the batches' impurity profiles may change during their shelf life due to reactions among the reactive underfluorinated compounds. Pharmaceutical processing steps involving the impact of energy can trigger such changes. This may be one reason for the significant differences between batches derived from the same raw materials.</p><p>The impurity groups we detected can cause different side effects. We identified reactive underfluorinated impurities and their degradation product (HF) as one reason for the toxic effect of Ala<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>octa batches.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Notably, the individual risks of each type of impurity may be increased by interaction with other impurity groups, as that happens with the supporting effect of surface-modifying compounds during tissue transition.</p><p>The time-dependent differences in the cytotoxic effect of the batches tested can be explained by differences in the amount of reactive underfluorinated impurities and varying HF content, as this ratio is unstable over time. Therefore, the detection of both acute and latently toxic impurities of this type, using the so-called H-value as the limit test, plays an important role when characterizing a safe PFO-endotamponade.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>This raises the question of whether the current regulations and standards now in force are in fact being adequately and legally enforced. In this context, the current International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards and Conformit&#x000e9; Europ&#x000e9;enne markings on medical devices in Europe are subject to particular criticism. In these discussions, however, there is often too little distinction drawn between the measures taken to set specific parameters and the steps necessary gaining approval based on fulfilling those parameters (determination of specifications) and for ensuring that the products conform to specifications, that is, that all batches being routinely produced are also in conformity with the specifications and fully comply with approval requirements. The relevant parameters and their determination are set out in the standards of the ISO series. The approval requirements themselves and the requirement for the products' compliance are currently regulated in the Medical Device Direction in Europe. From 2020, the much stricter Medical Device Regulations regulations will apply. One essential regulation is that new risks and findings be identified through continuous market observation, and that they be incorporated within the specifications and standards.</p><p>We place this work in this context. There is strong evidence that all detected impurities can be plausibly traced back to the manufacturing of raw materials and their further processing. Applying a risk-based approach, this must be reflected in appropriate specifications with appropriate limits both for the PFO-specific impurities and for those impurities that may contaminate the product through the production of specific dosage forms. Only after separating all impurities, in particular those of reactive underfluorinated impurities, can the batches' stability be achieved and their toxicity (and all other unwanted side reactions) be completely avoided. Our revelation of the different chemical constitutions of individual impurity groups shows that this is only achievable by combining different purification steps that consider the impurities' various chemical properties and are adapted to them.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-24-f06">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the effectiveness of such a Good manufacturing Practice-controlled purification process using batch 061014 as an example.
