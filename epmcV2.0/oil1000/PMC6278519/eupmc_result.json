    "Agarwood, the resinous wood in the heartwood of Aquilaria trees, has been used as incense in traditional Chinese medicine for its sedative, aphrodisiac, carminative, and anti-emetic effects. Grading of agarwood is usually based on its physical properties. Therefore, it is important to develop analytic methods for judgment and grading of agarwood. Here, we created a headspace (HS) preheating system that is combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS GC-MS) to analyze the chemical constituents in the incense smoke produced by agarwood. Incense smoke generated in the HS preheating system was injected directly to GC-MS for analysis. A total of 40 compounds were identified in the incense smoke produced by Kynam agarwood, the best agarwood in the world. About half of the compounds are aromatics and sesquiterpenes. By analyzing chemical constituents in the incense smoke produced by Vietnamese, Lao, and Cambodian varieties of agarwood, we found that butyl hexadecanoate, butyl octadecanoate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate, and squalene were common in the aforementioned four varieties of agarwoods. 2-(2-Phenylethyl) chromone derivatives were identified only in the incense smoke produced by Kynam agarwood, and were the major ingredient (27.23%) in the same. In conclusion, this is the first study that analyzes chemical profiles of incense smoke produced by agarwood using HS GC-MS. Our data showed that 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone derivatives could be used to assess quality of agarwoods. Moreover, HS GC/MS may be a useful tool for grading quality of agarwood."
