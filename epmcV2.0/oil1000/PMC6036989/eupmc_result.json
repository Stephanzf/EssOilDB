    "In this study, the gross composition and mineral content of Nigella sativa seed powder (NSP) and fatty acid composition of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) were investigated. The ability of NSP, extract (NSE) and NSO in reducing the effects of cisplatin-induced renal toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats were examined. The obtained results showed that NSP contains high amounts of carbohydrates, protein, and fiber while NSO has higher amounts of linoleicacid, oleic acid, and myristic acid. Rats treated with NSP, NSO, and NSE exhibitedreducedserum levels of urea, creatinine, and potassium, and a significant increase of Na, Na/K, vitamin D, nutritional markers, and antioxidant enzymes compared to the cisplatin-induced renal toxicity group receiving no Nigella sativa seed treatment. This study determined that all powder, oil, and extracts of N. sativa contain potent bioactive components that may aid in treatment against cisplatininduced renal toxicity in rats."
