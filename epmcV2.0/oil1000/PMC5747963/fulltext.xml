Wound repair is a crucial process and tissue regeneration enhancement and infection prevention are key factors to minimize pain, discomfort, and scar formation. The aim of this work was the development of lipid nanoparticles (solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers [NLC]), to be loaded with eucalyptus or rosemary essential oils and to be used, as medical devices, to enhance healing of skin wounds. Lipid nanoparticles were based on natural lipids: cocoa butter, as solid lipid, and olive oil or sesame oil, as liquid lipids. Lecithin was chosen as surfactant to stabilize nanoparticles and to prevent their aggregation. The systems were prepared by high shear homogenization followed by ultrasound application. Nanoparticles were characterized for physical&#x02013;chemical properties, bioadhesion, cytocompatibility, in vitro proliferation enhancement, and wound healing properties toward normal human dermal fibroblasts. Antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles was evaluated against two reference microbial strains, one of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, the other of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>. Finally, the capability of nanoparticles to promote wound healing in vivo was evaluated on a rat burn model. NLC based on olive oil and loaded with eucalyptus oil showed appropriate physical&#x02013;chemical properties, good bioadhesion, cytocompatibility, in vitro proliferation enhancement, and wound healing properties toward fibroblasts, associated to antimicrobial properties. Moreover, the in vivo results evidenced the capability of these NLC to enhance the healing process. Olive oil, which is characterized by a high content of oleic acid, proved to exert a synergic effect with eucalyptus oil with respect to antimicrobial activity and wound repair promotion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>lipid nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>eucalyptus essential oil</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial properties</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wound repair is one of the most complex physiologic processes, involving a multitude of different cell types, the contribution of which is tightly regulated over time. The breakdown of such a complex path could result in wound healing failure, leading to nonhealing wounds. The typical path of wound repair includes overlapping stages of inflammation, new tissue generation, and subsequent remodeling of neoformed tissue. These stages take place over dramatically different timescales, lasting from minutes (initial clotting and coagulation) to several months or even years.<xref rid="b1-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Chronic wounds (including venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, arterial insufficiency, and pressure ulcers) determine severe morbidity and even mortality especially in older individuals, in particular those affected from diabetes mellitus and vascular diseases. In addition, surgery, more common in older population, presents risk of wound complication. In general, chronic wounds deeply affect quality of life and wound care requires high costs of therapy.<xref rid="b3-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Resident cells are less proliferating in chronic wounds and possess a morphology similar to that of senescent cells. In particular, fibroblasts of chronic wounds (long-lasting vascular leg ulcers) are characterized by a poorer response to platelet-derived growth factor, altered capability of transforming growth factor beta type II receptor expression, and abnormal phosphorylation of critical signal transduction proteins. Such features are typical of cells exposed to low oxygen tension, suggesting that chronic wounds are hypoxic.<xref rid="b3-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The effect of microbial burden on healing of chronic wound is not completely understood and it is probably underestimated.<xref rid="b2-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The presence of a biofilm was indicated as a critical factor and a correlation between depth and duration of the lesion and the presence of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> strains was demonstrated.<xref rid="b4-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Moreover, microbial wound colonization (typically due to <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, and some <italic>Clostridium</italic> strains) was proved responsible for a further delay in wound recovery.<xref rid="b5-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Burns are skin wounds that can affect a significant portion of the body.

The incorporation of BrdU was detected by an immunostaining reaction with anti-BrdU antibody (Amersham Bioscience, VWR) as follows: the substrates were washed with PBS and incubated with HCl 2N for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were neutralized in 0.1 M sodium tetraborate (pH 8.5) for 15 min, washed twice for 5 min in PBS, and incubated for 20 min in a blocking solution, consisting of 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02% w/v Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS.

Finally, cell substrates were again extensively washed with PBS, counterstained for DNA with 0.5 mg/mL Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich), and mounted in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich).

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated after 24 h incubation at 37&#x000b0;C as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited the formation of visible microbial growth. Control test tubes contained microorganisms in culture broth without nanoparticles. Various concentrations of each sample were tested.</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo wound healing efficacy in rat model</title><p>All experiments on animals were carried out in full compliance with the standard international ethical guidelines (European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC), approved by Italian Health Ministry (D.L. 116/92). The study protocol was approved by the Local Institutional Ethics Committee of the University of Pavia for the use of animals. Male rats (Wistar 200&#x02013;250 g) were anesthetized with equitensine at 3 mL/kg (39 mM pentobarbital, 256 mM chloral hydrate, 86 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10% ethanol v/v, and 39.6% propyleneglycol v/v) and shaved to remove all hair from their backs. Three circular full-thickness burns, having a diameter of 4 mm, were produced on the back of the animals by contact with an aluminum rod (105&#x000b0;C for 40 s). Twenty-four hours later, the formed blisters were removed using a 4-mm diameter biopsy punch to obtain full-thickness lesions. Either 20 &#x000b5;L of nanoparticles suspension or 20 &#x000b5;L of nanoparticles suspension containing 5% w/w pull as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, was applied to the lesions. Lesions treated with 20 &#x000b5;L of saline solution were considered as control. After treatment, each lesion was protected with a sterile gauze and the rat&#x02019;s back was wrapped with a surgery stretch (Safety, Bovisio Masciago, Italy). At prefixed times after blister removal (0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 18 days), photographs of the lesions were taken by a digital camera (Sigma SD 14, Sigma Corporation, Milan, Italy), which allowed sizing of the lesions and monitoring the healing process. Each treatment was repeated after each photograph. The dimensions of wounded area were determined by an image analysis software (ICY, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Histologic analysis</title><p>After 18th day treatment, the animals were killed, full-thickness biopsies were made in correspondence of the lesion area, and histologic analysis of the excised tissues was performed. A biopsy of intact skin was also taken for comparison. Tissue samples were bisected along the widest line of the wound, fixed for 48 h in 4% w/v neutral buffered paraformaldehyde, dehydrated with gradient ethanol series, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (8 &#x000b5;m) were obtained using a Leitz microtome (Wetzlar, Germany) and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E).

Lecithin was used as surfactant to stabilize nanoparticles and to avoid their aggregation. NLC o/e was characterized by a PS of 200&#x02013;300 nm and demonstrated to be physically stable up to 3 months (2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C). It showed good bioadhesive properties, probably determined by NLC flexibility, which could promote interaction with the biologic substrate and the consequent bioadhesive joint formation; this is an important feature to allow an intimate contact between formulation and lesion, to assure treatment efficacy. NLC o/e showed good biocompatibility and proliferation properties toward normal human fibroblasts in an in vitro wound healing model. These properties could be due to the presence of olive oil, a fatty acid with a high content of oleic acid, already known for its good proliferation enhancement potential.</p><p>Encapsulation of eucalyptus oil in NLC did not impair its antimicrobial properties against two gram-positive bacterial strains commonly present in the skin (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>).</p><p>The results of in vivo rat burn model represented a proof of concept of efficacy and safety of NLC o/e developed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Dr F Saporito wishes to thank ABOCA Societ&#x000e0; Agricola S.p.A. for supporting her PhD grant.
