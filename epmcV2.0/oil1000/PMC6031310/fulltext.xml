health brings a new perspective on the way to treat and maintain both weight and
nutritional status of those who underwent the surgery. The surgical process is
effective in combating obesity grades II and III, and, due to this, there is an
exponential increase in the number of operations performed around the world<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The patient undergoing bariatric surgery, whether by means of mixed gastric bypass
technique or by restrictive vertical gastrectomy, must maintain a strict nutritional
order for promoting subcutaneous fat loss and preservation of muscle mass<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. The operation per se promotes the desired weight loss, but food reeducation
and physical activity are priorities. The most commonly used food guide is the Food
Pyramid<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>, but it does not accurately translate to the patient how to compose the
daily meals. </p><p>The process of food re-education is fundamental for many types of situations that
require special nutritional care. The first plate model came up to treat cardiopath
and dyslipidemic patients<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. It is a simple form of nutritional guidance because it aims at the greater
goal of the patients under orientation, which is their understanding in the daily
reality in which they live. Facilitating the educational process is the role of the
nutritionist. For orientation, it is necessary to create a clear and practicable
method for the person undergoing a surgery. </p><p>With this objective, this study seeks to discuss the Bariatric Plate Model (BPM),
which is a simple way to demonstrate to the patients how the macro and
micronutrients can be distributed in their daily meals, so as to favor their weight
loss and the maintenance of their nutritional status in the long term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><p>The Plate Model<sup>2</sup> was revised; it was a model of plate suggested initially
for dyslipidemic and hypertensive patients. Adaptation made to the bariatric
patient, who needs effective long-term nutritional education, to orientate the
consumption of adequate amounts of protein with high biological value, followed by
vitamins and minerals and lastly the carbohydrates, especially the whole ones </p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Bariatric surgery is an effective form of weight loss; however, for long-term
results, food quality should be prioritized, as the volumetric capacity of the
stomach is reduced and requires supplementary nutritious foods. There is a natural
change in the alimentary profile of the patient by reducing the intake of sweets in
general, which are highly palatable and energetic, and an increase in the
consumption of hyperproteic foods<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The everyday life of the patients should be simplified with a more easily
understandable way of composing their daily meals. Therefore, it is necessary to
demonstrate, through the composition of the BPM, how to plan the plate from the
first meal to the last of the day, and how important the nutrients are in the
choices they will make.</p><sec><title>Caloric restriction</title><p>Bariatric surgery, both by restrictive and mixed technique, requires a reduction
in daily caloric intake compatible with the reduction of gastric pouch. Thus the
daily calorific value ingested by a patient starts on average with 500 kcal in
the liquid feed and progressively evolves to a solid consistency up to 1.200
kcal per day. Nutritional recommendations following bariatric surgery are
described in guidelines that mention the need for protein from 1-1.5 g/kg of
ideal weight (60-80 g/day, 25%), carbohydrates (45%) and lipids (30%)<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Macro and micronutrients are very important for the maintenance of the health of
the patient. Among the macronutrients, the most important one is the protein.
</p></sec><sec><title>Proteins</title><p>Proteins are biological macromolecules made up of one or more chains of amino
acids and participate in almost all cellular processes. They have essential
functions such as DNA replication, molecular transport and response to stimuli.
They function as enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions vital to metabolism,
participate in the cell cycle and in the immune response. Proteins differ
fundamentally in their amino acid sequence, which is determined by the genetic
sequence and which generally causes their knotting in a specific
three-dimensional structure that determines their activity<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The essential amino acids are those which the body is not able to synthesize by
itself and must be obtained by the consumption of foods that contain proteins,
which are transformed into amino acids during the digestion<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Protein sources can be found in a wide variety of plant and animal foods. Meat,
eggs, milk and fish are complete sources. Among the main vegetables rich in
protein are the vegetables, especially beans, lentils, soybeans and chickpeas.
Most amino acids are available in human food, but special situations, such as
bariatric surgery, require supplementation. When the body does not receive the
necessary amounts of protein, there is protein insufficiency and malnutrition,
which can lead to a number of diseases, including kwashiorkor, alopecia and
intense muscular loss<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Many patients may develop intolerance to iron-rich protein foods due to
inadequate mastication and also by the decrease of hydrochloric acid and
proteolytic enzymes such as pepsinogen. Their consumption should be encouraged
through specific chewing and portioning training sessions<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Half (50%) of the plate must contain proteins.</p><p>For meals such as lunch and dinner, one should place sources of iron-rich
proteins such as meats - beef, chicken, fish and eggs - to make up half of the
plate, that is, 50% of the total to be ingested. Always use low fat options. The
average food intake of the operated patients is around 4-6 tablespoons of food
per meal. Therefore, it would be 2-3 tablespoons of food coming from proteins.
As they are accompanied by some lipid content, the orientation is to use them in
the baked, cooked or grilled form to minimize caloric value and facilitate
consumption by the operated patient<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>For the breakfast or snacks, it is necessary to prioritize sources of calcium
rich proteins, such as milk and dairy products. Start the day with skim milk,
cottage-type cheeses, ricotta or Minas cheese (white cheese) and sugar-free
yogurts. The use of yogurts is excellent for maintaining the consumption of
natural probiotics, responsible for the rebalancing of intestinal bacteria and
protection against intestinal dysbiosis<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Iron-rich protein food sources should be used in separate meals such as lunch and
dinner, calcium-rich meals such as breakfast, and snacks to promote the
absorption of these micronutrients<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,2</sup>.</p><p>Protein supplementation is critical. To achieve daily nutritional needs after
bariatric surgery, the use of Whey Protein should occur throughout life. The use
of powdered supplements should start as early as the first day of liquid feeding
and be kept throughout life. It is ideal to use isolated, hydrolyzed,
lactose-free, gluten-free and sucrose-free formula to facilitate use adhesion.
The powder can be diluted in water by being better absorbed, or in skimmed
milk<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Vitamins and minerals</title><p>One third of the plate (30%) should be occupied by the group of vitamins,
minerals and fibers, represented by fruits and vegetables in general. They are
fibrous foods that require chewing. It is important to vary the colors from day
to day to strengthen the immune system, regenerate the skin and regulate
metabolism. Moderation is the watchword. Excess vitamins and minerals can be
dangerous. Some vitamins, such as sun exposure D, pyridoxine (B6) and biotin,
are released by intestinal bacteria<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The most important and most discussed nutrients are vitamins A, D,
B<sub>12</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, calcium and iron<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The vitamins can be water soluble and fat soluble. In the BPM it is necessary
that both be present. Water-soluble vitamins, such as those from complex B, need
to be eaten raw to maintain their nutritional value<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Using colors is ideal for motivating the consumption of the maximum of nutrients
possible in the meals. The yellow and red ones are rich in vitamin A (fat
soluble) and responsible for keeping hair, skin and nails healthy; their best
sources are carrots, beets, pumpkin and bovine liver. The greens are rich in
vitamins of the B complex, and represented by the leafy ones like cabbage,
mustard, chard, lettuce and arugula, which prevent anemia. Citrus fruits are
rich in vitamin C and important in iron fixation and enhancement of immunity;
they are present in orange, lemon, passion fruit, acerola, green apple, tomatoes
and grapes. The white ones, such as onions, garlic, mushrooms, cauliflower, palm
hearts, okra, are excellent in preventing cardiovascular disease and cancer<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The vitamin B1 (tiamine) is present in the germ of wheat, beans, nuts, seeds and
brown rice. It is important for the patients because it protects them from
bariatric beriberi, which is a postoperative complication that can lead the
patient to severe cardiological and neurological complications, edema and
nutritional amblyopia. Its supplementation in severe situations can reach up to
100 mg/day<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A complete multivitamin complex can meet the daily needs of vitamins, always
coupled with sufficient food intake. Vitamin B2 or riboflavin is found in
avocados, dairy products, eggs, nuts, wheat germ and yeast. It is very important
in the cellular respiration, maintenance and restoration of the tissues. Vitamin
B3 or niacin is essential for skin health, participates in the metabolism of
carbohydrates, protects the digestive system and nervous system. Its richest
sources are fish, liver, meat, yeast, peanut and whole grains. Vitamin B5 or
pantothenic acid is important for macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of
the nervous system. It is also produced by intestinal bacteria. Vitamin B6 or
pyridoxine participates in the metabolism of proteins and in the formation of
red blood cells found in bananas, fish, potatoes and also produced by intestinal
bacteria. Vitamin B9 or folic acid present in dark green leaves and orange
participates in DNA production, cell division, neural tube formation of the
fetus, formation of red and white blood cells and protection against pernicious
anemia, common in bariatric patients<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. The vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin, on the contrary, is present only in
foods of animal origin, normally rich in proteins such as meats, milk and their
derivatives. Its absorption is greatly impaired after gastric bypass due to the
reduction of the intrinsic factor of the stomach and loss of its absorptive
site, which is the ileum. Its lack is risky to the nervous system, because it
can cause forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty of concentration and tingling
in hands and feet. Even if the patient consumes these foods, this vitamin must
be permanently replenished throughout life, either orally, intramuscularly or
sublingually<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. Biotin (vitamin H) is from the B-complex and is not dosed by
traditional hematological tests, but it is very important for maintaining the
health of hair, skin and nails and should be restored whenever there is a
complaint. In usual food it is present in egg yolk, wheat germ and also produced
by intestinal bacteria<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.Vitamin D or cholecalciferol is important for weight maintenance and
also for bone metabolism. Their dietary sources are limited to milk and dairy
products, eggs and liver. Its biggest source is sunlight, so it is recommended
that the patient sunbathe daily, preferably without sunscreen for 15 min.
Synthetic supplementation is routine in both the previous and postoperative
period, on average 2000 UI per day<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Vitamin E (fat soluble vitamin) or tocopherol is a potent antioxidant
and protective of cell membranes. Its best sources are almonds and milk. Vitamin
K (fat soluble) - menaquinone or phylloquinone - is important for blood clotting
and produced by intestinal bacteria. The best sources are broccoli, cabbage and
kale<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>The food sources of vitamins and minerals in general are confused with other
groups of macronutrients, as is the case of the vitamin B12 and zinc, which have
as their main sources the foods rich in animal proteins such as meats, chicken,
milk and their derivatives.</p></sec><sec><title>Carbohydrates</title><p>The rest of the plate should consist of carbohydrates, which are energetic foods,
important for daily life. The choice in this group is for the whole-grain foods.
Whole carbohydrates with breads, rice, pasta and cereals tend to decrease the
absorption of sugars and fats, which favors cardiovascular health, in addition
to promoting better satiety power<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

</p></sec><sec><title>Lipids</title><p>They are insoluble chemicals in water. They are important macronutrients to
provide essential fatty acids. Suggested sources are: canola oil and olive oil.
Canola oil is encouraged because it is safe for humans, as well as for its
positive effects on variables such as reduced tumor cell growth, increased
antioxidant capacity, increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance as
well as reduction of total triacylglycerol and LDL cholesterol<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. The prevention of alopecia in operated patients must also be mentioned.
Olive oil, which is a common lipid source in the Mediterranean diet, rich in
oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid (&#x003c9;9) that is present in concentrations
higher than 50% in olive oil <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Nutrition supplements</title><p>The use of nutritional supplements is mandatory and requires periodic metabolic
control to analyze the need for each specific nutrient. The use of Whey Protein
can improve body composition in women and also prevent weight return<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">

operation. As the food intake is lower than expected, we encourage the use of
Whey Protein, one to two scoops per day, with an average of 25 g of protein as
measure<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">

orally per day; iron in 18 mg orally for men, 50-100 mg orally for women in
childbearing age. In some specific cases there may be a need to use intravenous
iron (ferritin below 30 mg/dl); calcium with 2000 mg per day; enough polyvitamin
to reach 200% of the RDA for micronutrients<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
