    "Essential oils (EOs) have gained increasing attention due to their pharmacological effectiveness, and they also constitute some of the most popular natural products. In this study, we present the chemical characterization of the EO from Phania matricarioides and the in vitro activity/selectivity against a wide panel of bacteria, fungi and parasitic protozoa. Forty-five compounds were identified in the studied EO, of which lavandulyl acetate (40.1%) and thymyl isobutyrate (13.9%) were the major components. The EO did not inhibit bacterial or fungal growth at the maximum concentration tested (64 µg/mL), although it displayed activity on all evaluated protozoa (IC50 values ranging from 2.2 to 56.6 µg/mL). In parallel, the EO demonstrated a noteworthy cytotoxic activity against peritoneal macrophages (CC50 values of 28.0 µg/mL). The most sensitive microorganism was Trypanosoma cruzi, which had a superior activity (IC50 = 2.2 µg/mL) and selectivity (SI = 13) in respect to other parasitic protozoa and the reference drug (p < 0.05). Further in vivo studies are needed to evaluate the potential use of this EO and the main compounds as antitrypanosomal agents. To our knowledge, this is the first report of chemical characterization and antimicrobial assessment of the EO from P. matricarioides."
