    "In this study, docosahexaenoic acid powder-enhanced gelatin-chitosan edible films were prepared by casting, electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning, respectively. The color (CR), transparency (UV), light transmission (UV), mechanical strength (TA-XT), thermal stability (DSC), crystalline structures (XRD), molecular interactions (FTIR), and microstructure (SEM) were assessed in the analytical research. The results of the research showed that the electrospinning process and the coaxial electrospinning process produced a smooth surface visible to by the naked eye and a uniform granular network structure in a unique film-forming manner, thereby exhibiting good water solubility and mechanical properties. In contrast, the casted film was smooth, transparent, and mechanically strong but poorly water soluble. It was also found that the addition of docosahexaenoic acid powder affected the optical, physical and mechanical properties of the film to varying degrees."
