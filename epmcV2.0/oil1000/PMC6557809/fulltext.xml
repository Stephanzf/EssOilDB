The color (CR), transparency (UV), light transmission (UV), mechanical strength (TA-XT), thermal stability (DSC), crystalline structures (XRD), molecular interactions (FTIR), and microstructure (SEM) were assessed in the analytical research. The results of the research showed that the electrospinning process and the coaxial electrospinning process produced a smooth surface visible to by the naked eye and a uniform granular network structure in a unique film-forming manner, thereby exhibiting good water solubility and mechanical properties. In contrast, the casted film was smooth, transparent, and mechanically strong but poorly water soluble.

The resulting nanofibers have a smooth surface and controlled morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Coaxial electrospinning can produce micro/nano fibers with a core-shell structure and highly different compositions, which is an improvement over simple electrospinning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The nanofiber particles created by electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning are ideal for many applications such as biosensors, enzyme immobilization, drug delivery, scaffold tissue engineering, wound healing, and so on<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The difference is that casting involves the application of a polymer solution on a substrate and then removal of the solvent to cause molecular orientation of the polymer molecules, resulting in film formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, studies on the characterization of nanoparticles polymer films fabricated by different methods, especially coaxial electrospinning have been scarce. As a biopolymer, we selected gelatin obtained from flounder, which has been FDA approved. <italic>Paralichthys orbignyanus</italic>, also known as the flounder, is an economically important fish that lives in temperate water and rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Current research on flounders has mainly focused on farming, breeding and rough machining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. A large amount of waste materials, such as fish skin and bones, are left during the processing of flounder, especially the bones, which account for about 40% of the whole fish. Therefore, flounder bones were used as the material from which to extract and purify gelatin by the hot-water extraction method.</p><p id="Par3">Edible films used in drug and food packaging are biodegradable, naturally renewable and edible biopolymers. Polysaccharides and proteins are used in various fields as a basic excellent macromolecule substance. The typical combination gelatin-chitosan (GC) biocomposite membrane is a type of &#x0201c;green packaging&#x0201d; material with excellent development potential that has been studied by some researchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Gelatin molecules are rich in biological functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups that have excellent biocompatibility and are potential film-forming materials. Chitosan is the only natural polysaccharide with a large amount of basic aminopolysaccharide, which is non-toxic, degradable, bacteriostatic, and biocompatible and has good film forming properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In recent years, to change the performance and characterization of GC films, functional ingredients such as inorganic salts, phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid and ginger essential oils have been studied by some researchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combined with polysaccharides-proteins has not been studied in recent reports. DHA is a major substance in the growth and maintenance of nervous system cells and an important component of the brain and retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Supplementing &#x003c9;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can effectively reduce some risk of disease in the long term. The scientific novelty of the work is that we found that fish oil full of &#x003c9;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids combined with protein to form the emulsions but seldom films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, we selected DHA algal oil powder as the core material and functional ingredient, combined with coaxial electrospinning and other processes to prepare membrane materials with good biocompatibility and safety and then to compare their structure and physicochemical properties; we hope the result can be used in the food packaging and biomedical fields.</p><p id="Par4">The essential objective of the present research was to compare the properties of edible films formed by different methods for better delivery of &#x003c9;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and analyze the influence and interaction of macromolecular nutrient complexes on edible film. In this study, we used geltain-chitosan as the wall material and mixed or embedded docosahexaenoic acids powders as the core material, using casting, electrospinning, and coaxial electrospinning to form 5 different films. The structure and physicochemical properties were analyzed and studied to provide a scientific basis for the development and utilization of a new gelatin edible film and for industrial application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Water solubility and color measurement of the films</title><p id="Par5">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts different film formation methods using a source component with a water-soluble of DHA fortified sample and a control sample.

The addition of DAS in electrospinning could significantly increase the light transmittance, which may cause varying degrees of light scattering as a result of the DAS distributed throughout the film. In the visible region of 350&#x02013;800&#x02009;nm, the transparency of the edible films gradually stabilized with increased wavelengths of ultraviolet light.

However, the possibility of using DHA source components to achieve higher L* values or brighter edible film output can be considered an advantage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">Determining the optical properties of thin films and coating application capabilities on the food surface is critical, because these will influence the appearance of the coating product, which is a necessary quality factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. All edible films exhibited excellent UV barrier properties in the ultraviolet range of 200&#x02013;250&#x02009;nm regardless of type and essential DAS incorporated (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which causes oxidative deterioration of food packaging, resulting in discoloration, nutrient, loss, and odor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This result was in consistent with those of previous reports on gelatin-chitosan films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, which demonstrated that protein-based films were believed to have high ultraviolet barrier properties, such as high content of the UV-absorbing aromatic amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan. The reason that the transmittance of GC-DTE was significantly lower than that of GC-DE was the unique combination of core and wall material in coaxial electrospinning. The transmittance of GC-DE film, in which DHA algal oil powder was directly mixed with gelatin-chitosan by electrospinning, was higher than that of GC-DTE film, in which DHA algal oil powder as a core material was combined with gelatin-chitosan,and the electrospun film without DHA algal oil powder had the lowest light transmittance. The increase in the transparency of the edible film was associated with the addition of DAS, and the color component of DAS and the destruction of the ordered membrane protein network also reduced the transparency of the edible film containing DAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The addition of DAS had an influence on the appearance and light-blocking properties of the edible films composed by different modes, and in particular, the ultraviolet barrier property was enhanced, which was beneficial to slow down the deterioration of DHA algal oil powder caused by ultraviolet radiation. In practice, the color of the packaged food and the acceptability of the color of the film should be considered in selecting different suitable edible films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">Typically, edible film requires sufficient mechanical strength and ductility to withstand extrinsic stresses and keep its barrier properties and integrity during packaging applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The mechanical strength of the edible film was studied to assess the processing performance and to reveal further information about internal structures. There was a significant difference in tensile strength between GC-C and GC-DC, and the tensile strength decreased with the addition of DAS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). This phenomenon may be due to the immiscibility and microphase separation of the mixture, resulting in easier chain slip under load and less physical entanglement interaction between polymer chains. Complex materials had mesoscopic microphase-separated structures, which were different from ordinary single-crystal or polycrystalline materials. Their performance depended not only on the properties of the molecule, but more importantly on the self-assembly of the molecules and the formation of microphase-separated structures from the nanometer to micrometer scale, which may be the deeper reason for the difference. Unlike other methods of adding DAS, coaxial electrospinning had the same effect as without DAS. It should be mentioned that the mechanical strength of the electrospun films was weaker than that of the casting films. The result was the same as other have authors&#x02019; reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The difference between the different methods is probably due to physical entanglement between the polymer blend of the chain interactions, resulting in the chain slides in a loading difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">The melting temperature of the films corresponded to the dissociation of polymer chains. The endothermic peaks in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> mainly reflected the destruction of the hydrogen bond between gelatin molecules and the physical crosslink formed between chitosan and gelatin and DAS and the rearrangement of the gelatin&#x02019;s triple helix structure. Compared to the electrospinning process, the solvent casting had a similar melting temperature, with a small gap. Higher than the melting temperature of the report of Hosseini<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, concluded that the addition of DAS into gelatin and chitosan films, was perhaps a result of the ability of DAS to penetrate between polymer chains, thereby weakening the interaction between proteins and polysaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The endothermic peaks in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> mainly indicate destruction of the physical hydrogen bonds between the chitosan molecules and the physical crosslinking formed between the mixtures and the rearrangement of the gelatin&#x02019;s triple helix structure. The increase in the thermal stability of the composite membrane and the decrease in endothermic degree are due to the bonding among gelatin and chitosan and DAS in different ways, and crosslinking is an important way of bonding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, the triple helix content or crystallinity were reflected through the characteristic endothermic peaks, which were consistent with the XRD results.</p><p id="Par17">X-ray diffraction analysis is a method of analyzing the internal atomic space structure of a substance by utilizing the diffraction effect of X-rays in the crystal material. However, the crystallinity of the film formed by electrospinning was significantly lower than that of the film formed by casting, and the film formed by coaxial electrospinning had the lowest crystallinity. Moreover, that of the film with DAS added was significantly lower than that of the film without DAS under the same conditions, indicating that the addition of DAS may reduce the crystallinity of the gelatin-chitosan film. The reduced peak intensity may be due to intermolecular crystal between the hydroxyl group of the DAS gelatin and NH<sub>2</sub> side chain groups of the interaction, which limited the movement of molecules and thus prevented crystallization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">According to Kittiphattanabawon <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, the amide A band usually appears in the range of 3400&#x02013;3440&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and is related to the N&#x02013;H free stretching vibration, whereas C&#x02013;H stretching vibrations of aliphatic groups at 2914&#x02013;2929&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are the amide B.
