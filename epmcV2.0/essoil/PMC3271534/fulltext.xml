RAW 264.7, a murine macrophage-like cell lines, often play an important role in secreting inflammatory mediators and especially associate with endotoxin effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Pro-inflammatory genes are activated via signal transduction pathways that lead to the production of proinflammatory parameters such as nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), and interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] NO is produced by activating inflammatory cells. NO is synthesized from L-arginine through the action of constitutively expressed NO synthase (eNOS) and an inducible NO synthase (iNOS).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The augmentation of NO production by LPS is solely dependent on the expression of iNOS. Once iNOS is induced, it produces excessive amounts of NO which profoundly influence cell and tissue function and damage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In the biological system, NO has many functions such as vasodilation, neurotransmission, and inflammatory response.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] TNF-&#x003b1; is produced in the early phase of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages. TNF-&#x003b1; mediates early-stage responses of inflammation by regulating the production of other cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6. Therefore, it is suggested as an important therapeutic approach to regulate the production of proinflammatory mediators for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases.</p><p>The <italic>Broussonetia papyrifera</italic> is a tree in the family Moraceae, which grows well in Eastern Asia and also widely found in Taiwan.

The fractionation of <italic>B. papyrifera</italic> extract produced with hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate generated fractions that could inhibit NO production caused by LPS. In contrast, the aqueous and butanol fractions were ineffective in reducing NO release. This can be explained by the high polarity of the solvents used in these fractions, which extract polar compounds that are either poorly absorbed through the cell or lack anti-inflammatory activity.</p><p>In this study, we have observed that the hexane fraction of <italic>B. papyrifera</italic> showed the strongest anti-inflammatory activity (ID<sub>50</sub> = 32.15 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml), exhibited greater potency than dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions. The extracts exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in the order of magnitude &#x02013; hexane extract &#x0003e; ethyl acetate &#x0003e; dichloromethane extract. In fact, it was the only one with a higher potency than the methanol extract. Therefore, we thought that most of the anti-inflammatory compounds or the compounds with the highest potency were concentrated in the hexane fraction.</p><p>In conclusion, the results revealed the anti-inflammatory activity of <italic>B. papyrifera</italic> stem bark on LPS-induced proinflammatory parameters in RAW 264.7 cells. The NO release, iNOS protein, and mRNA expression was decreased by BP-H. However, the expression of iNOS gene regulated by BP-H has not been elucidated and that the gene regulation need to be further examined.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
