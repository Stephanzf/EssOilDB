Here, we investigated for the first time the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of the ethanolic (EtOH) and aqueous extracts from the leaves of <italic>Lantana montevidensis</italic> in human leukocytes, as well as their possible interaction with human erythrocyte membranes <italic>in vitro</italic>. The antioxidant activities of both extracts were also investigated in chemical and biological models. Treatment of leukocytes with EtOH or aqueous extracts (1-480 &#x000b5;g/mL) did not affect DNA damage index, but promoted cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (240-480 &#x000b5;g/mL). Both extracts did not modify the osmotic fragility of human erythrocytes. The extracts scavenged DPPH radical and prevented Fe<sup>2+</sup>-induced lipid peroxidation in rat's brain and liver homogenates, and this was likely not attributed to Fe (II) chelation. The HPLC analysis of the extracts showed different amounts of polyphenolic compounds (isoquercitrin, gallic acid, catechin, ellagic acid, apigenin, kaempferol, caffeic acid, rutin, quercitrin, quercetin, chlorogenic acid, luteolin) that may have contributed to these effects.

This is at least in part, because their chemical constituents may have antioxidant activity, thereby, preventing the oxidative damage resulting from oxidative stress, which has been implicated in many diseases including stroke, cancer and other neurodegenerative diseases (Uttara et al., 2009[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; Visconti and Grieco 2009[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; Rodrigo et al., 2013[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; Kamdem et al., 2016[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). </p><p>The genus <italic>Lantana</italic> is composed of about 150 species (Ghisalbert, 2000[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) in which <italic>L. camara</italic> and <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> are represented. The two species are very similar from a botanical point of view and are used in popular medicine as carminative, antispasmodic, antiemetic and to treat respiratory infections, rheumatism, wounds, asthma, biliary fever, bronchitis, tumor, ulcers, high blood pressure, among others (Barreto et al., 2010[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; Kalita et al., 2012[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). </p><p>Although, <italic>L. camara</italic> is well studied for its pharmacological properties (Kalita et al., 2012[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), it is recognized so far among the most toxic plants (Ghisalbert, 2000[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; Kalita et al., 2012[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Its toxic effects to human and livestock has been reported in Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa and America, and were attributed to the presence of lantadenes A, B and D (Kalita et al., 2012[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). In addition, the essential oil obtained from the leaves of <italic>L. camara</italic> was recently found to be toxic to NCTC929 fibroblasts (Barros et al., 2016[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]).</p><p><italic>L. montevidensis</italic> (Family, Verbenaceae), popularly known as &#x0201c;camar&#x000e1;&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;cambar&#x000e1;&#x0201d;, is a sprawling shrub native to Brazil and Uruguay. It is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant (Taylor, 2015[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). The dried leaves of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> prepared in different ways (infusion, maceration, decoction), and its essential oil have been traditionally used for the same purposes like <italic>L. camara</italic> (Hashimoto, 1996[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). In opposition to the widely studied <italic>L. camara</italic>, very few studies have demonstrated the pharmacological potential of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic>. Extracts and essential oil from the leaves of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> have been reported to exhibit antibacterial activity with the potential to modulate antibiotics drugs used in clinical infections (Barreto et al., 2010[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; Sousa et al., 2013[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). In addition, methanolic extract of the leaves showed anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, analgesic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities (Sousa et al., 2015[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). Phytochemical studies revealed that the flavonoid fraction from the leaves of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> exhibits antiproliferative activity against human gastric adenocarcinoma, human uterine carcinoma and murine melanoma cell lines (Nag&#x000e3;o et al., 2002[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Triterpenoids and flavones are likely to be the major components of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> leaves extracts (Makboul et al., 2013[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), while &#x003b2;-caryophyllene, germacrene and bicyclogermacrene are the main constituents of its essential oil (Sousa et al., 2013[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). </p><p>Considering the lack of information in the literature regarding the biological activities of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic>, and its chemical composition, the present study aimed to chemically characterize the aqueous and ethanolic extracts from the leaves of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic>, evaluate their bioactive properties. Their potential antioxidant (DPPH, TBARS, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelation) activities, toxic effects (genotoxicity and cytotoxicity), as well as the influence on osmotic fragility were also investigated in human leukocytes and erythrocytes respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>All chemicals were of analytical grade.

Quercetin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, kaempferol, luteolin, apigenin and rutin were acquired from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) was performed with a Shimadzu Prominence Auto Sampler (SIL-20A) HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with Shimadzu LC-20AT reciprocating pumps connected to a DGU 20A5 degasser with a CBM 20A integrator, SPD-M20A diode array detector and LC solution 1.22 SP1 software. 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ascorbic acid, malonaldehydebis-(dimethylacetal) (MDA), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), sodium azide and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.

The aqueous extract of <italic>L. montevidensis </italic>was prepared by crushing 300 g of fresh leaves, mixed with 2 L of hot water and the mixture was allowed to stand for 3 days. While the ethanolic extract (EtOH) was prepared by crushing 300 g of fresh leaves and macerating in 1.5 L of 92 % ethanol, this was also allowed to stand for 3 days. On the 3<sup>rd</sup> day, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure and lyophilized to obtain a dark brown solid. The prepared extracts (aqueous and ethanolic) were stored in the freezer until being used. </p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of aqueous and ethanolic extracts from the leaves of L. montevidensis by HPLC-DAD</title><p>Reverse phase chromatographic analysis was carried out under gradient conditions using Phenomenex C<sub>18 </sub>column (4.6 mm x 250 mm) packed with 5 &#x003bc;m diameter particles; the mobile phase was: (A) acetonitrile: water (95:5, v/v) and (B) water: phosphoric acid (98:2, v/v), and the composition gradient was: 5 % of B until 10 min and changed to obtain 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 70 % and 100 % B at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min, respectively, following the method described by Colpo et al.

The ethanolic and aqueous extracts from the leaves of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> and the mobile phase were filtered through 0.45 &#x003bc;m membrane filter (Millipore) and then degassed by ultrasonic bath prior to use. The extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> were analyzed at 30 mg/mL. The flow rate was 0.6 mL/min and the injection volume was 50 &#x003bc;L. Stock solutions of standard references were prepared in the HPLC mobile phase at a concentration range of 0.025 - 0.400 mg/mL for catechin, quercetin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, kaempferol, luteolin, apigenin and rutin; and 0.030 - 0.250 mg/ml for gallic, chlorogenic, ellagic and caffeic acids. Quantification of these compounds was carried out by integration of the peaks using the external standard method, at 270 nm for gallic and ellagic acids, 280 nm for catechin, 327 nm for chlorogenic and caffeic acids, and 365 for quercetin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, kaempferol, apigenin, luteolin and rutin. The chromatography peaks were confirmed by comparing its retention time with those of reference standards and by DAD spectra (200 to 600 nm). The calibration curve for the standards used is presented in Table 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were calculated based on the standard deviation of the responses and the slope using three independent analytical curves.

(2012[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) with some modifications. Briefly, 50 &#x000b5;L of ethanolic and aqueous extracts in different concentrations (1-480 &#x000b5;g/mL) were mixed with 100&#x000b5;L of freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.3 mM in ethanol). The plate was kept in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The reduction of DPPH color was measured by monitoring the decrease in absorption at 517 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax, USA). Ascorbic acid was used as positive control. The percent DPPH inhibition was calculated as follows:</p><p>% inhibition = 100 - [100 (A<sub>sample</sub> - A<sub>blank</sub>)/A<sub>control</sub>], where A<sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the tested sample with DPPH; A<sub>blank</sub>, the absorbance of the test tube without the addition of DPPH and A<sub>control</sub> is the absorbance of DPPH solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Fe<sup>2+ </sup>chelating activity of the extracts </title><p>The Fe<sup>2+ </sup>chelating activity of the ethanolic and aqueous extracts from the leaves of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> was determined using a modified method of Kamdem et al.

The reaction mixture containing 58 &#x000b5;L of saline solution (0.9 %, w/v), 45 &#x000b5;L Tris-HCl (0.1 M, pH, 7.5), 27 &#x000b5;L of extracts (1-60 &#x000b5;g/mL) and 36 &#x000b5;L of 110 &#x000b5;M FeSO<sub>4</sub> was incubated for 10 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. Subsequently, 34 &#x000b5;L of 1,10-phenanthroline (0.25 %, w/v) was added and the absorbance of the orange coloured complex formed was measured at 0, 10 and 20 min at 510 nm (against blank solutions of the samples) using microplate reader (SpectraMax, USA). The same procedure was performed for the control (i.e., Fe<sup>2+</sup>, without the extract). To ascertain the chelating potential of the extracts, we determined the potential reduction of any Fe<sup>3+</sup> (that might be formed during the incubation periods) by adding the reducing agent, ascorbic acid (to give a final concentration of 5 mM) to the reaction mixture. The absorbance was then determined after 5, 10 and 20 min following ascorbic acid addition. This is because the extracts could be oxidizing Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, leading to a decrease in absorbance that was not related to Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelation. Schedule for the evaluation of Fe<sup>2+ </sup>chelation or oxidation by the extracts is presented in Table 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>. </p></sec><sec><title>Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay</title><p>TBARS production was determined as described by Ohkawa et al.

At the lowest concentration tested (1 &#x000b5;g/mL), the radical scavenging potential of the aqueous extract (24.20 &#x000b1; 2.32 %) was more pronounced, even than that of ascorbic acid (9.55 &#x000b1; 2.01 %).

As it can be seen in Figure 2A and 2B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>, EtOH (1-60 &#x000b5;g/ mL) and aqueous extracts (1-60 &#x000b5;g/mL) caused a decrease in the absorbance at 510 nm compared with Fe<sup>2+</sup>. In order to investigate whether the reduction in the absorbance in the presence of extracts was attributed to Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelation or oxidation, ascorbic acid (AA) was added to the reaction medium after 20 min of incubation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> with the extracts and orthophenanthroline. Addition of ascorbic acid caused only a modest increase in the absorbance at 510 nm and this was more apparent for the aqueous extract (Figure 2B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>). The most plausible interpretation of these results is that the extracts can chelate Fe<sup>2+</sup> and accelerate the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup>. However, this Fe<sup>3+</sup> was only partially or not released from the complex; because otherwise ascorbic acid should have reduced Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>, resulting to the formation of the complex between Fe<sup>2+</sup> and orthophenanthroline.

Both extracts caused a significant reduction in the amount of MDA produced when compared to the basal (p &#x0003c; 0.05; Figure 3A and 3B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). The basal inhibition with the EtOH extract was effective at 240 &#x000b5;g/mL where its maximum effect was attained (Figure 3A<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>).

Although <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> has been used for the same purpose as <italic>L. camara</italic>, there are however, very limited studies on its pharmacological activities as well as its safety. In this context, this study aimed at investigating the antioxidant capacity of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> using various assays' systems, and its toxicity in human leukocytes and erythrocytes.</p><p>In biological system, antioxidants are extremely important due to their direct removal of pro-oxidants in order to ensure maximum protection for biological sites (Pisoschi and Pop, 2015[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; Kamdem et al., 2016[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; Hassan et al., 2017[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Iron(II) is a potent pro-oxidant that has been found to be increased in many neurodegenerative disorders associated with oxidative stress, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (Zecca et al., 2008[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; Becerril-Ortega et al., 2014[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Indeed, Fe<sup>2+</sup> has been extensively used <italic>in vitro</italic> to access the antioxidant potential of chemicals or plant extracts, since it can induce oxidative stress via the generation of ROS (Harris et al., 1992[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). In the current study, Fe<sup>2+</sup> caused a significant increase in the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA), one of the most abundant by-products of lipid peroxidation (LPO) generated via radical-initiated oxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acid (Singh, 2015[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Interestingly, EtOH and aqueous extracts from the leaves of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> efficiently inhibited Fe<sup>2+</sup>-induced LPO in rat brain and liver homogenates. These results suggest that the components of both extracts may have interacted with free radicals or chelated free iron, thereby, rendering it unavailable for the Fenton process. Our results are in agreement with that of Sousa et al. (2015[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) who showed that leaf and root extracts of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> inhibit Fe<sup>2+</sup>-induced LPO in egg phospholipids.</p><p>The biological activity of transition metals such as iron is associated with the presence of unpaired electrons that favour their participation in redox reaction (Repetto et al., 2010[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). For instance, they can participate in the initiation step of LPO, DNA assault and oxidative stress through metal-catalyzed reactions (Aitken, 2014[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Hassan et al., 2017[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Here, we have investigated the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-chelating ability of EtOH and aqueous extracts of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic>. The results demonstrated that both extracts did not chelate Fe<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that their antioxidant capacity observed against LPO seems to be associated with direct action with free radicals and not Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelation. </p><p>The free radical scavenging activity of EtOH and aqueous extracts was evaluated by the DPPH assay. In this assay, the purple color of the DPPH is changed to the yellow color in the presence of hydrogen donating antioxidant. Thus, the more yellowish color of DPPH observed, the greater is the antioxidant activity of the tested compound/extract. Both extracts caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the color of DPPH radical, suggesting their hydrogen donating ability. However, the aqueous extract exhibited a higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than the EtOH extract. The difference in this activity may be explained by the ability of the aqueous extract to quickly donate hydrogen atoms to the DPPH radical than the EtOH extract. It has been postulated that molecules that can donate hydrogen atoms to damaged molecules can be considered as repair compounds (Kohen and Nyska, 2002[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Thus, it is possible to extrapolate that the donation of hydrogen atoms by EtOH and aqueous extracts to fatty acid radical which was previously attacked by a radical (and lost its hydrogen) in the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-induced LPO, has contributed to limit the damages or inhibit LPO.</p><p>The exceptional growth of human exposure to natural products particularly from plants origin has led to the resurgence of the scientific interest in their biological activities, with emphasis on their toxicological evaluations in order to ascertain their safety (Kamdem et al., 2013[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; Barbosa-Filho et al., 2014[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; Waczuk et al., 2015[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; Duarte et al., 2016[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Substantial evidences from literatures reveal that plants used in traditional medicine or as food can have mutagenic, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo </italic>(Zink and Chaffin, 1998[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; Celik, 2012[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Here, the effect of EtOH and aqueous extracts of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> on DNA of human leukocytes was evaluated by the comet assay, which is regarded as a valuable biomarker of genotoxicity (Mati&#x00107; et al., 2013[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). We found that both extracts (1-480 &#x000b5;g/mL) did not have genotoxic effect in relation to the control. However, at the higher concentrations tested (240-480 &#x000b5;g/mL), they showed a slight cytotoxic effect. Although we have not identified the constituent(s) responsible for the cytotoxic effect, some of the compounds identified includes rutin, quercetin and kaempferol, and these have been shown to have toxic effects at relatively high concentrations (Soares et al., 2006[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Consequently, it is possible to presume that the DNA damage evaluated by the Comet assay can occur in parallel or not with the toxicity detected as decreased survival (by Trypan blue). Despite the fact that it is difficult to translate the <italic>in vitro</italic> results obtained here to a real <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, our findings suggest that caution should be taken regarding the dosage and the frequency use of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> in the traditional medicine.</p><p>Exposure of human erythrocytes to phyto-therapeutic products can influence erythrocyte membrane integrity making the cells more fragile and labile to damage (Mpiana et al., 2010[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). In the present study, osmotic fragility was used as a useful cytotoxic indicator to evaluate the interactions of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> extracts with the cell membrane <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> extracts did not have any effect on the osmotic fragility of erythrocytes, suggesting that the antioxidant defense system of the erythrocytes may have contributed to protect the cell membranes. </p><p>The chemical composition of<italic> L. montevidensis</italic> extracts showed the presence of polyphenolic compounds (phenolic acids and flavonoids). Their long-term consumption has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes among others in epidemiological studies (Lall et al., 2015[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). Therefore, the action of these phytochemicals alone or synergistically could be responsible for radical scavenging activity and the prevention of LPO observed in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the present study investigated for the first time, the toxicity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts from the leaves of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> in human cells, and their antioxidant activity in various assay systems. Exposure of human leukocytes to higher concentrations of both extracts (240-480 &#x000b5;g/mL) caused cytotoxicity, without any sign of DNA damage, indicating that caution should be taken regarding the dosage and frequent use of <italic>L. montevidensis</italic> in traditional medicine. However, treatment of human erythrocytes with both extracts (1-480 &#x000b5;g/mL) did not have any effect on erythrocyte membranes. The ethanolic and aqueous extracts exhibited strong antioxidant activity as evidenced by their DPPH radical scavenging activity and their efficacy to inhibit lipid peroxidation in rat brain and liver homogenates. These effects can be attributed to the presence of bioactive phytochemicals found in <italic>L. montevidensis</italic>, and may therefore justify its pharmacological use in folk medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest with any person or any organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Dr. Luiz Marivando Barros is particularly grateful to the CAPES/DINTER/URCA-UFSM Program.
