    "The major objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of enzymatic pretreatment on Lantana camara for improved yield of reducing sugar and bioethanol production. An optimum enzymatic delignification (88.79 %) was achieved after 8 h of incubation. After delignification the substrate was further treated with the mixture of carbohydratases for appropriate saccharification. The enzyme treated substrate yielded maximum reducing sugar (713.33 mg/g dry substrate) after 9 h of saccharification. Monosaccharide content in the saccharified samples were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Using conventional yeast strain, 9.63 g/L bioethanol was produced from saccharified samples of Lantana camara. Structural changes of Lantana camara before and after enzymatic pretreatment were further investigated through Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)."
