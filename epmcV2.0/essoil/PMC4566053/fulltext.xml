Climate changes and global warming are increasing the temperature of earth hence becoming an ultimate cause of water scarcity. It is need of the day to use potential soil amendments that could increase the plants&#x02019; resistance under such situations. Biochar and gypsum were used in the present study to improve the water use efficiency (WUE) and growth of <italic>Abelmoschus esculentus</italic> L. Moench (Lady&#x02019;s Finger). A 6 weeks experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions. Stress treatments were applied after 30 days of sowing. Plant height, leaf area, photosynthesis, transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance and WUE were determined weekly under stressed [60% field capacity (F.C.)] and non-stressed (100% F.C.) conditions. Stomatal conductance and Tr decreased and reached near to zero in stressed plants. Stressed plants also showed resistance to water stress upto 5 weeks and gradually perished at sixth week. On the other hand, WUE improved in stressed plants containing biochar and gypsum as compared to untreated plants. Biochar alone is a better strategy to promote plant growth and WUE specifically of <italic>A. esculentus</italic>, compared to its application in combination with gypsum.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Abelmoschus</italic></kwd><kwd>biochar</kwd><kwd>water use efficiency</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>stomatal conductance</kwd><kwd>transpiration rate</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="66"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Drought is a long period of weather dryness due to lack of rainfall in any area that creates a serious imbalance of water and moisture deficiency for agriculture. Climate change and global warming are two basic environmental issues that are caused by anthropogenic activities making agricultural crisis even more severe. High temperature and severe weather conditions are the causes of flash floods, drought and glacier melting. Due to these climatic changes, earth is becoming warmer and drier and ultimately resulting in water scarcity.</p><p>Water stress has become a worldwide problem, as it is a threat to the sustainability of agriculture (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Shao et al., 2005</xref>). Asian countries including Pakistan are agriculture based countries and their agricultural productivity and yield is adversely affected due to water shortage. This water crisis affects the productivity as well as yield of crops (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Huaqi et al., 2002</xref>). In arid and semiarid regions, water stress is also faced by plants in two conditions, either when water supply is reduced or the rate of transpiration may become very high than the normal rate (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Tan and Weaver, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, some plant species are resistant to drought stress. Such tolerance in plants may vary from specie to specie due to the adaptation of different mechanisms (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaitanya et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, there are some crops that can grow under deficit water by adopting different drought tolerance mechanisms such as acclimation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bohnert and Sheveleva, 1998</xref>), osmotic adjustment (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Saab et al., 1992</xref>), hormonal control and stomatal closure etc. (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez-Blanco et al., 2002</xref>). In arid and semiarid regions water use efficiency (WUE) of plants indicates the crop productivity as well as water use by different plants (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). It is measured with reference to water and CO<sub>2</sub> used during the process of photosynthesis (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Swarthout et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>There are some soil amendments that increase drought resistance for plants and also improve the WUE. Biochar is an example of such amendments which are used as a solution of drought stress for many plants. It contains 80% of carbon that has the ability to conserve water and nutrients for plants and hence considered as drought enduring material (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Novak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Major et al., 2010</xref>). The application of biochar to soil is useful in many respects. It improves the soil microbial interaction and activity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pietikainen et al., 2000</xref>), shows retention of nutrients in the soil (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wardle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lehmann et al., 2003</xref>) and at the same time increases water holding capacity of the soil (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Laird et al., 2010</xref>). Biochar is applied along with any fertilizer; thus the crop shows enhanced productivity toward such amendments (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Steiner et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Different plant species can be used to prepare biochar from their biomass. In many subtropical areas of the world <italic>Lantana camara</italic> is an invasive plant that not only affects the grazing lands but also reduces the soil nutrients for other useful plants. To overcome this problem, <italic>L. camara</italic> can be removed from such lands and could be used to prepare biochar from its biomass solving the disposal issue.</p><p>Many studies have investigated the impact of biochar addition on the performance and drought resistance of plants. As soil amendments like biochar has been proposed as a potential measure to increase agricultural productivity, by improving water holding capacity, along with enhanced nutrient retention of the soil. Apart from biochar, gypsum is also a well known soil amendment to enhance the quality of soil as well as its water retention capacity. Gypsum is known to improve the plant productivity (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 1993</xref>), enhances nutrient availability to plants (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Vyshpolsky et al., 2010</xref>), improves soil moisture content by altering water holding capacity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Oudat et al., 1998</xref>), improves soil structure, infiltration rate and enhances water movements in soil (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chi et al., 2012</xref>) and also promotes the root system of plants (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ritchey et al., 1995</xref>). As biochar and gypsum are porous materials these possess high water holding capacity. Hence, in the present study, the beneficial effect of biochar and gypsum are supposed to be further enhanced by combined application of biochar and gypsum on <italic>Abelmoschus esculentus</italic> L. Moench (commonly called as &#x0201c;Okra&#x0201d;). For the present study Lady&#x02019;s finger was selected, as it requires short duration to complete its life cycle. In addition, it is a common crop which has an important nutritious value as containing carbohydrates, proteins, iron, Vitamin A, B, and C (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dilruba et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The current study was aimed:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02022; To improve the WUE of <italic>A. esculentus</italic> L.

Like biochar treatment, similar results were found for the combination of biochar and gypsum. At 100% F.C. of all treatments (0% B + 0% G, 1% B + 0.1 % G, 3% B + 0.1% G) stomatal conductance remained the same throughout the experimental period. On the other hand in stressed treatments i.e., at 60% F.C. for all treatments (0% B + 0% G, 1% B + 0.1% G, 3% B + 0.1% G) it was decreased upto zero for 0% B + 0% G as compared to others where it didn&#x02019;t reach to zero at the end of the experiment.

In addition, stomatal conductance was higher in gypsum treated plants (236 mmolH<sub>2</sub>O m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) as compared to control (217mmol H<sub>2</sub>O m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). In contrast, at 60% F.C. (60% F.C. + 0% G, 60% F.C. + 0.1% G) stomatal conductance was gradually decreased upto 3 weeks then it was decreased rapidly upto zero in 60% F.C. with no gypsum as compared to gypsum treated plants where it was 59 mmolH<sub>2</sub>O m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>.

WUE is the ability of the crop to produce biomass per unit of water transpired. In this scenario of water stress, WUE can be regarded as an important adaptive trait to drought environment. Previous works have revealed the physiological basis of drought stress in different plants. The present study was made to check the potential of biochar along with gypsum in improving WUE under water stress conditions to study the effect of drought on growth parameters in <italic>A. esculentus</italic> L. Moench (Lady&#x02019;s Finger).</p><p>Soil used for the experiment, represented typical water scares and stressed sandy loam, from dry sub-tropical conditions, with low organic matter, neutral pH, having EC 3.03 &#x003bc;S/cm. It has been observed that biochar and gypsum gave the positive response toward an overall improvement of the studied soil parameters. While pH, EC, moisture content and organic matter was increased in all treated plants as compared to the control soil. Our results followed similar trends established in different studies involving application of biochar in increasing soil pH and EC when applied on tomato (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mustafa et al., 2010</xref>) as well as on rice (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand it was found that 1% biochar application rate was the more effective treatment compared to other rates. Our findings coincide with a significant increase in plant height of tomatoes with treatment of 1% biochar as compared to 0 and 3% biochar (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ellen et al., 2010</xref>). <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Howard (2011)</xref> reported the similar pattern of increase in plant height for corn and soybean by increasing the rate of biochar from 1.5 to 3% while, decreased compared to control level by increasing the rate of biochar upto 6%. We have found the positive effect on plant growth with application of various combinations of biochar and gypsum, e.g., 1% biochar along with 0.1% gypsum as the best combination to increase plant height in control soils at the same time for stressed plants too. Similarly <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mustafa et al. (2010)</xref> reported that plant height was higher in biochar treatments along with fertilizer as compared to biochar alone, while <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Sumner and Larrimore (2006)</xref> reported similar pattern with gypsum and biochar for cotton crop.</p><p>It has been reported that leaf area of plants decreased by decreasing the amount of water. <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">McGiffen et al. (1992)</xref> reported 50% reduction in leaf area increase on restricting the water supply of plants. In our study, leaf area was significantly increased up to 3 weeks when the F.C. was maintained but after that increasing rate was less in all stressed plants (60% F.C.) as compared to non-stressed (100% F.C.). Similarly, it has been investigated that 60% maintained F.C. had enough moisture to increase the leaf area as well as the Tr (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Masinde et al., 2006</xref>). <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sankar et al. (2008)</xref> reported similar trend of leaf area reduction, with the application of same rate of stress (60%) applied to <italic>A. esculentus</italic> L. Moench. Several other studies report similar results, for other higher plants (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Thakur and Kaur, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Agreeing with our findings of a significant reduction in stomatal conductance with stress application, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Galm&#x000e9;s et al. (2007)</xref> reported that different plant species showed decrease in stomatal conductance with water stress. Besides this, a higher stomatal conductance indicated that plants can survive under severe drought conditions for longer period of time (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gindaba et al., 2005</xref>). Biochar has been found to increase the stomatal conductance as compared to control (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Solaiman et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kusvuran (2012)</xref> reported a continuous decline in stomatal conductance in melon (<italic>Cucmis melo</italic>) with no soil amendment. Moreover, same trend was also observed in chickpea (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mafakheri et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Impatiens capensis</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Heschel and Rignos, 2005</xref>). Our study plants responded to drought by decrease in leaf area as well as the transpiration, agreeing with the trend established by <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jones (1992)</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, Tr was declined due to reduction in leaf area of stressed plants (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Borrell et al., 2000</xref>). On the contrary it has also been reported that decline in Tr is due to reduction in stomatal conductance rather than decrease in leaf area (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Stutzel, 2002</xref>). Tr was also reduced when the same F.C. (60%) was maintained for Lady&#x02019;s finger plants by <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sankar et al. (2008)</xref>. Tr of control (no soil amendment) was zero at the end of experiment rather than a bit high in biochar and gypsum treatments. It showed that biochar and gypsum has given the stability to respond under water stressed environment.</p><p>Our findings for increase of Pns, with application of Biochar tallied with the findings of biochar increased the Pn of wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) and clover (<italic>Trifolium subterranean</italic>) under drought stress condition as compared to control and fully watered plants (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Solaiman et al., 2010</xref>). Similar results were found in tobacco plant indicating that photosynthesis and stomatal conductance do not always have direct relationship (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Von-Caemmerer et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast photosynthesis also decreased in numerous species of <italic>Robinia pseudoaccacia</italic> (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) and almond specie (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Rouhi et al., 2007</xref>). Besides this an increasing trend was observed in Pn of clover (<italic>Trifolium subterranean</italic>) with biochar treated plants under drought stressed conditions (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Solaiman et al., 2010</xref>). <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ippolito et al. (2011)</xref> reported that 2% of biochar increased 3&#x02013;7% of moisture content that enhanced the rate of photosynthesis as well. Water stress in a crucial abiotic factor that considerably influence the plant in many ways. In a study by <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Azhar et al. (2011)</xref> the photosynthetic rate showed non-significant reduction from 100% F.C. to 80% F.C. but increased at 60% F.C. as observed in our case. Such results suggest that there exist certain plants which perform better in water stress environments and thus cultivation of such plants under drought stress conditions should be encouraged.</p><p>Coincided with other studies for increased WUE in <italic>A. esculentus</italic> L. Moench, some other plant species also reported to show improved WUE under drought stress conditions as compared to fully watered plants (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2006</xref>). Many studies have shown same results that decrease in Tr and increase in Pn have known to increased WUE (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kimball et al. (1994)</xref> reported that Pn was increased due to increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and finally WUE was also increased due to increased net photosynthesis. In contrast, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Murray (1995)</xref> reported that WUE was increased due to decreased stomatal conductance and <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al. (1994)</xref> reported that CO<sub>2</sub> was increased due to Tr and so increased WUE was due to decreased Tr.</p><p>In the present study, Tr was reduced and Pn was increased that caused an increase in WUE. In previous studies WUE was also determined for different species such as sweet potato (4.89 mmolmol<sup>-1</sup>), rice (3.28 mmolmol<sup>-1</sup>), soybean (3.68 mmolmol<sup>-1</sup>) and maize (9.23 mmolmol<sup>-1</sup>). In the same study WUE was improved due to increased photosynthesis and decreased transpiration (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jianlin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In case of our findings for increase in biomass, a similar 20% increase in dry weight was obtained in biochar along with gypsum applied plants as compared to biochar and gypsum alone (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mustafa et al., 2010</xref>). For our findings of change in dry weight for the gypsum treatment of stressed and control, a comparable finding (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 1992</xref>) for dry matter reduction in stressed plants as compared to non-stressed plants due to low rate of transpiration and small leaf area. Similar results were also found when the same rate of water stress was imposed on the plants of Lady&#x02019;s finger (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sankar et al., 2008</xref>). Several studies have shown a higher photosynthetic rate under the optimal water (60% level of F.C.) conditions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Azhar et al., 2011</xref>). In general, there is a positive relationship between photosynthesis and biomass accumulation of plants, particularly with the addition of biochar (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Reddy and Das, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hossain et al., 2012</xref>). The results of our study showed a higher rate of photosynthesis at 60% F.C., but the highest biomass was recorded at water level of 100% F.C. This means that other physiological processes such as the high rate of respiration might have hindered the biomass accumulation of plant. However, more research is needed to establish the relationship between the rate of respiration, photosynthesis and biomass accumulation at different soil amendments and water stress levels.</p><p>Different plants can withstand certain level of pH and lady&#x02019;s finger can suitably grow under 6&#x02013;8 pH. With the amendment of biochar, it overcomes the negative effects of pH at 1%. But at 3% concentration, the pH increased which resulted in reduction of positive effect of biochar (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Howard, 2011</xref>). Our experiment depicted the similar situation of good results with 1% biochar as compared to 3%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Water being essential in growth and development of plants, a specific amount of water is needed for optimum growth. WUE in rain fed areas is the most important limiting factor for the plant growth. Increasing temperature of earth due to anthropogenic activities, Climate changes and severe weather conditions are reasons for flash floods, drought and glacial retreat, destabilized watersheds are heading toward water scarcity. Pakistan is facing increasing drought stress, being an agriculture based economy. In the current scenario soil amendments can prove to be the best methods to overcome drought stress.</p><p>In this study biochar and gypsum were used to improve the infiltration rate and water holding capacity of soil in which <italic>A. esculentus</italic> L. Moench seedlings were grown for 4 weeks and then stress treatments were imposed. The variations were noted and assessment of growth as well as physiological parameters was done in experimental conditions.</p><p>Among all treatments, 1% biochar alone as well as along with gypsum gave significant results for all parameters as compared to control and other treatments. It is finally concluded that biochar alone is a better strategy to promote plant growth specifically of <italic>A. esculentus</italic> L. Moench, compared to the application of gypsum and combination of biochar and gypsum under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. Furthermore, at 60% F.C. Lady&#x02019;s finger showed resistance as well as improved WUE. Therefore, it is considered beneficial in water stressed regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Oudat</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Arslan</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanakri</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1998</year>). <article-title>Physical and chemical properties, plant growth, and radionuclide accumulation effects from mixing phosphogypsum with some soils.</article-title>
